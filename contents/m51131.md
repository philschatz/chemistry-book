In 1923, G. N. **Lewis**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} proposed a generalized definition of acid-base behavior in which acids and bases are identified by their ability to accept or to donate a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond.

A **coordinate covalent bond**{: data-type="term"} (or dative bond) occurs when one of the atoms in the bond provides both bonding electrons. For example, a coordinate covalent bond occurs when a water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form a hydronium ion. A coordinate covalent bond also results when an ammonia molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form an ammonium ion. Both of these equations are shown here.

A Lewis acid-base reaction occurs when a base donates a pair of electrons to an acid. A **Lewis acid-base adduct**{: data-type="term"}, a compound that contains a coordinate covalent bond between the Lewis acid and the Lewis base, is formed. The following equations illustrate the general application of the Lewis concept.

The boron atom in boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, has only six electrons in its valence shell. Being short of the preferred octet, BF<sub>3</sub> is a very good Lewis acid and reacts with many Lewis bases; a fluoride ion is the Lewis base in this reaction, donating one of its lone pairs:

A Brønsted-Lowry acid such as HCl is an acid-base adduct according to the Lewis concept, and proton transfer occurs because a more stable acid-base adduct is formed. Thus, although the definitions of acids and bases in the two theories are quite different, the theories overlap considerably.

Many slightly soluble ionic solids dissolve when the concentration of the metal ion in solution is decreased through the formation of complex (polyatomic) ions in a Lewis acid-base reaction. For example, silver chloride dissolves in a solution of ammonia because the silver ion reacts with ammonia to form the **complex ion**{: data-type="term"} <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>Ag</mtext><msub><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mrow /><mn>+</mn></msup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

A complex ion consists of a central atom, typically a transition metal cation, surrounded by ions, or molecules called **ligands**{: data-type="term"}. These ligands can be neutral molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O or NH<sub>3</sub>, or ions such as CN<sup>–</sup> or OH<sup>–</sup>. Often, the ligands act as Lewis bases, donating a pair of electrons to the central atom. The ligands aggregate themselves around the central atom, creating a new ion with a charge equal to the sum of the charges and, most often, a transitional metal ion. This more complex arrangement is why the resulting ion is called a *complex ion*. The complex ion formed in these reactions cannot be predicted; it must be determined experimentally. The types of bonds formed in complex ions are called coordinate covalent bonds, as electrons from the ligands are being shared with the central atom. Because of this, complex ions are sometimes referred to as coordination complexes. This will be studied further in upcoming chapters.

The equilibrium constant for the reaction of the components of a complex ion to form the complex ion in solution is called a **formation constant (*K*<sub>f</sub>)**{: data-type="term"} (sometimes called a stability constant). For example, the complex ion <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>Cu</mtext><msub><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>CN</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mrow /><mtext>−</mtext></msup></mrow></math>

The inverse of the formation constant is the **dissociation constant (*K*<sub>d</sub>)**{: data-type="term"}, the equilibrium constant for the *decomposition* of a complex ion into its components in solution. We will work with dissociation constants further in the exercises for this section. [Appendix K](/m51230){: .target-chapter} and [\[link\]](#fs-idm57488576) are tables of formation constants. In general, the larger the formation constant, the more stable the complex; however, as in the case of *K*<sub>sp</sub> values, the stoichiometry of the compound must be considered.

As an example of dissolution by complex ion formation, let us consider what happens when we add aqueous ammonia to a mixture of silver chloride and water. Silver chloride dissolves slightly in water, giving a small concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> (\[Ag<sup>+</sup>\] = 1.3 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo></math>

The large size of this formation constant indicates that most of the free silver ions produced by the dissolution of AgCl combine with NH<sub>3</sub> to form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>Ag</mtext><msub><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mrow /><mn>+</mn></msup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 As a consequence, the concentration of silver ions, \[Ag<sup>+</sup>\], is reduced, and the reaction quotient for the dissolution of silver chloride, \[Ag<sup>+</sup>\]\[Cl<sup>–</sup>\], falls below the solubility product of AgCl:

More silver chloride then dissolves. If the concentration of ammonia is great enough, all of the silver chloride dissolves.

    We write the equilibrium as a formation reaction because [Appendix K](/m51230){: .target-chapter} lists formation constants for complex ions.

# Key Concepts and Summary

G.N. Lewis proposed a definition for acids and bases that relies on an atom’s or molecule’s ability to accept or donate electron pairs. A Lewis acid is a species that can accept an electron pair, whereas a Lewis base has an electron pair available for donation to a Lewis acid. Complex ions are examples of Lewis acid-base adducts. In a complex ion, we have a central atom, often consisting of a transition metal cation, which acts as a Lewis acid, and several neutral molecules or ions surrounding them called ligands that act as Lewis bases. Complex ions form by sharing electron pairs to form coordinate covalent bonds. The equilibrium reaction that occurs when forming a complex ion has an equilibrium constant associated with it called a formation constant, *K*<sub>f</sub>. This is often referred to as a stability constant, as it represents the stability of the complex ion. Formation of complex ions in solution can have a profound effect on the solubility of a transition metal compound.

We have seen an introductory definition of an acid: An acid is a compound that reacts with water and increases the amount of hydronium ion present. In the chapter on acids and bases, we saw two more definitions of acids: a compound that donates a proton (a hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>) to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid, and a Lewis acid is any species that can accept a pair of electrons. Explain why the introductory definition is a macroscopic definition, while the Brønsted-Lowry definition and the Lewis definition are microscopic definitions.

In dilute aqueous solution HF acts as a weak acid. However, pure liquid HF (boiling point = 19.5 °C) is a strong acid. In liquid HF, HNO<sub>3</sub> acts like a base and accepts protons. The acidity of liquid HF can be increased by adding one of several inorganic fluorides that are Lewis acids and accept F<sup>–</sup> ion (for example, BF<sub>3</sub> or SbF<sub>5</sub>). Write balanced chemical equations for the reaction of pure HNO<sub>3</sub> with pure HF and of pure HF with BF<sub>3</sub>.

The simplest amino acid is glycine, H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H. The common feature of amino acids is that they contain the functional groups: an amine group, –NH<sub>2</sub>, and a carboxylic acid group, –CO<sub>2</sub>H. An amino acid can function as either an acid or a base. For glycine, the acid strength of the carboxyl group is about the same as that of acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, and the base strength of the amino group is slightly greater than that of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>.

(a) Write the Lewis structures of the ions that form when glycine is dissolved in 1 *M* HCl and in 1 *M* KOH.

(b) Write the Lewis structure of glycine when this amino acid is dissolved in water. (Hint: Consider the relative base strengths of the –NH<sub>2</sub> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo>−</mo><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mrow /><mtext>−</mtext></msup></mrow></math>

Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and quantum mechanics, we can use our understanding of quantum numbers to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another. This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical properties of that atom.

### Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure

The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, *n*, increases. In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of *l* differ so that the energy of the orbitals increases within a shell in the order *s* &lt; *p* &lt; *d* &lt; *f.* [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_eLeveldiag) depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1*s* orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy. The energy increases as we move up to the 2*s* and then 2*p*, 3*s*, and 3*p* orbitals, showing that the increasing *n* value has more influence on energy than the increasing *l* value for small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The 3*d* orbital is higher in energy than the 4*s* orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move up the chart.

 ![A table entitled, &#x201C;Subshell electron capacity,&#x201D; is shown. Along the left side of the table, an upward pointing arrow labeled, &#x201C;E,&#x201D; is drawn. The table includes three columns. The first column is narrow and is labeled, &#x201C;2.&#x201D; The second is slightly wider and is labeled, &#x201C;6.&#x201D; The third is slightly wider yet and is labeled, &#x201C;10.&#x201D; The fourth is the widest and is labeled, &#x201C;14.&#x201D; The first column begins at the very bottom with a horizontal line segment labeled &#x201C;1 s.&#x201D; Evenly spaced line segments continue up to 7 s near the top of the column. In the second column, a horizontal dashed line segment labeled, &#x201C;2 p,&#x201D; appears at a level between the 2 s and 3 s levels. Similarly 3 p appears at a level between 3 s and 4 s, 4 p appears just below 5 s, 5 p appears just below 6 s, and 6 p appears just below 7 s. In the third column, a dashed line labeled, &#x201C;3 d,&#x201D; appears just below the level of 4 p. Similarly, 4 d appears just below 5 p and 5 d appears just below 6 p. Six d however appears above the levels of both 6 p and 7 s. The far right column entries begin with a dashed line labeled, &#x201C;4 f,&#x201D; positioned at a level just below 5 d. Similarly, a second dashed line segment appears just below the level of 6 d, which is labeled, &#x201C;5 f.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_06_04_eLeveldiag.jpg "Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale)."){: #CNX_Chem_06_04_eLeveldiag}

Electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the 5*p* orbitals fill immediately after the 4*d*, and immediately before the 6*s*. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, *n*, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of *l* increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order *s* &gt; *p* &gt; *d* &gt; *f*. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron–nucleus attractions slightly (recall that all electrons have −1 charges, but nuclei have +*Z* charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1*s* through 3*p*), the increase in energy due to *n* is more significant than the increase due to *l*; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.

The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the **electron configuration**{: data-type="term"} of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Econfig)):

1.  The number of the principal quantum shell, *n*,
2.  The letter that designates the orbital type (the subshell, *l*), and
3.  A superscript number that designates the number of electrons in that particular subshell.
{: type="1"}

For example, the notation 2*p*<sup>4</sup> (read \"two–p–four\") indicates four electrons in a *p* subshell (*l* = 1) with a principal quantum number (*n*) of 2. The notation 3*d*<sup>8</sup> (read \"three–d–eight\") indicates eight electrons in the *d* subshell (i.e., *l* = 2) of the principal shell for which *n* = 3.

 ![A light blue hemisphere is labeled H. At a location about midway between the center and outer edge of the hemisphere, a small yellow-orange sphere is shown that is labeled with a negative sign. To the right of this diagram is the electron configuration 1 s superscript 1. The superscript is shown in a small yellow-orange circle. This superscript is labeled, &#x201C;Number of electrons in subshell,&#x201D; and the s is labeled, &#x201C;Subshell.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_06_04_Econfig.jpg "The diagram of an electron configuration specifies the subshell (n and l value, with letter symbol) and superscript number of electrons."){: #CNX_Chem_06_04_Econfig}

### The Aufbau Principle

To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can “build” the structures in the order of atomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the **Aufbau principle**{: data-type="term"}, from the German word *Aufbau* (“to build up”). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_eLeveldiag)), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Efillorder) illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Econtable) provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing *Z* order. For example, after filling the 3*p* block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed by the 3*d* orbitals.

 ![This figure includes a chart used to order the filling of electrons into atoms. At the top is a blue circle labeled &#x201C;1 s.&#x201D; In a row beneath this circle are 6 additional blue circles labeled &#x201C;2 s&#x201D; through &#x201C;7 s.&#x201D; A column to the right begins just right of 2 s and contains pink circles labeled 2 p through 7 p. A column to the right begins just right of 3 p and contains yellow circles labeled 3 d through 6 d. No circles are placed to the right of the 7 s and 7 p circles. A final column on the right begins right of 4 d. It includes grey circles labeled, &#x201C;4 f&#x201D; and, &#x201C;5 f.&#x201D; No circles are placed right of 6 d. Through these circles, arrows are included in the figure pointing down and to the left. The first arrow begins in the upper right and passes through 1 s. The second arrow begins just below and passes through 2 s. The third arrow passes through 2 p and 3 s. The fourth arrow passes through 3 p and 4 s. This pattern of parallel arrows pointing downward to the left continues through all circles completing the pattern 1 s 2 s 2 p 3 s 3 p 4 s 3 d 4 p 5 s 4 d 5 p 6 s 4 f 5 d 6 p 7 s 5 f 6 d 7 p.](../resources/CNX_Chem_06_04_Efillorder.jpg "The arrow leads through each subshell in the appropriate filling order for electron configurations. This chart is straightforward to construct. Simply make a column for all the s orbitals with each n shell on a separate row. Repeat for p, d, and f.

We will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. **Orbital diagrams**{: data-type="term"} are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Efillorder) or [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Econtable), we would expect to find the electron in the 1*s* orbital. By convention, the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (*n* = 1, *l* = 0, *m<sub>l</sub>* = 0, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

). The second electron also goes into the 1*s* orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same *n*, *l*, and *m<sub>l</sub>* quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:

The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first two electrons in lithium fill the 1*s* orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the 2*s* orbital ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Efillorder) or [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Econtable)).

There are three degenerate 2*p* orbitals (*m<sub>l</sub>* = −1, 0, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these *p* orbitals. When drawing orbital diagrams, we include empty boxes to depict any empty orbitals in the same subshell that we are filling.

The orbitals are filled as described by **Hund’s rule**{: data-type="term"}\: the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.

Note that down each group, the configuration is often similar."){: #CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf}

When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metal potassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to add electrons to the 3*d* subshell. However, all available chemical and physical evidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added to the 3*d* level but is, instead, added to the 4*s* level ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf)). As discussed previously, the 3*d* orbital with no radial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4*s*, which has three radial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of \[Ar\]4*s*<sup>1</sup>. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4*s* subshell and calcium has an electron configuration of \[Ar\]4*s*<sup>2</sup>. This gives calcium an outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium and magnesium.**

Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additional electrons are added successively to the 3*d* subshell. This subshell is filled to its capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for *l* = 2 \[*d* orbitals\], there are 2*l* + 1 = 5 values of *m<sub>l</sub>*, meaning that there are five *d* orbitals that have a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4*p* subshell fills next. Note that for three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y) through silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 *d* electrons are successively added to the (*n* – 1) shell next to the *n* shell to bring that (*n* – 1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 *f* electrons (*l* = 3, 2*l* + 1 = 7 *m<sub>l</sub>* values; thus, seven orbitals with a combined capacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (*n* – 2) shell to bring that shell from 18 electrons to a total of 32 electrons.

The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Efillorder) or [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Econtable). For instance, the electron configurations (shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf)) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.

In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the 4*s* into the 3*d* orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled 3*d* subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3*d* subshell (in Cu). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium (Nb, atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration \[Kr\]5*s*<sup>2</sup>4*d*<sup>3</sup>. Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually \[Kr\]5*s*<sup>1</sup>4*d*<sup>4</sup>. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron–electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the 5*s* orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the 5*s* and 4*d* orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

### Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table

As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number so that elements with the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their electron configurations are added to the table ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf)), we also see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties of the elements.

Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.

It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it has—the arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the same group. This arrangement is emphasized in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf), which shows in periodic-table form the electron configuration of the last subshell to be filled by the Aufbau principle. The colored sections of [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf) show the three categories of elements classified by the orbitals being filled: main group, transition, and inner transition elements. These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the **valence shell**{: data-type="term"}, or highest energy level orbitals of an atom.

1.  **Main group elements** (sometimes called **representative elements**) are those in which the last electron added enters an *s* or a *p* orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf). This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest *n* level. For example, gallium (Ga, atomic number 31) has the electron configuration \[Ar\]<u data-effect="underline">4*s*<sup>2</sup></u>3*d*<sup>10</sup><u data-effect="underline">4*p*<sup>1</sup></u>, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled *d* orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.
2.  **Transition elements or transition metals**. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added enters a *d* orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the *ns* and (*n* – 1) *d* electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled *d* orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg, as well as Cu, Ag, and Au in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf)) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire *d* block (colored yellow in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf)), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.
3.  **Inner transition elements** are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an *f* orbital. They are shown in green in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_06_04_Ptableconf). The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (*n* – 2)*f,* the (*n* – 1)*d*, and the *ns* subshells. There are two inner transition series:
    1.  The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
    2.  The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
    {: type="a"}
{: type="1"}

Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no *f* electrons.

### Electron Configurations of Ions

We have seen that ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are the first electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the *s*  orbital are easier to remove than the *d*  or *f*  electrons, and so the  highest  *ns*  electrons are lost, and then the (*n* – 1)*d*  or  (*n* – 2)*f* electrons are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are added to a parent atom. The added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle.

Next, determine whether an electron is gained or lost. Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions with a positive charge have *lost* an electron. For main group elements, the last orbital gains or loses the electron. For transition metals, the last *s* orbital loses an electron before the *d* orbitals.

### Key Concepts and Summary

The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals are filled (1*s*, 2*s*, 2*p*, 3*s*, 3*p*, 4*s*, 3*d*, 4*p*, and so on). Electron configurations and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).

Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last electron to be added is placed: main group elements (*s* and *p* orbitals), transition elements (*d* orbitals), and inner transition elements (*f* orbitals).

### Glossary
{: data-type="glossary-title"}

Aufbau principle
: procedure in which the electron configuration of the elements is determined by “building” them in order of atomic numbers, adding one proton to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell at a time
^

core electron
: electron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the inner shells
^

electron configuration
: electronic structure of an atom in its ground state given as a listing of the orbitals occupied by the electrons
^

Hund’s rule
: every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin
^

orbital diagram
: pictorial representation of the electron configuration showing each orbital as a box and each electron as an arrow
^

valence electrons
: electrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of *n*) of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts
^

valence shell
: outermost shell of electrons in a ground-state atom; for main group elements, the orbitals with the highest *n* level (*s* and *p* subshells) are in the valence shell, while for transition metals, the highest energy *s* and *d* subshells make up the valence shell and for inner transition elements, the highest *s*, *d,* and *f* subshells are included

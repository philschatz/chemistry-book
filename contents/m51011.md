We can argue that modern chemical science began when scientists started exploring the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of chemistry. For example, Dalton’s atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results of measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various compounds. Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of compounds allows us to quantitatively describe the composition of substances.

### Formula Mass

In an earlier chapter, we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average atomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the **formula mass**{: data-type="term"} of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substance’s formula.

#### Formula Mass for Covalent Substances

For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the production of tetrafluoroethylene, the building block for the \"anti-stick\" polymer, Teflon. The molecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the average atomic masses of these atoms. [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_01_chloroform) outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

#### Formula Mass for Ionic Compounds

Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to yield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound’s formula. Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to as the “molecular mass.”

As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations, Na<sup>+</sup>, and chloride anions, Cl<sup>−</sup>, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_01_saltMass)).

 ![A table and diagram are shown. The table is made up of six columns and four rows. The header row reads: &#x201C;Element,&#x201D; &#x201C;Quantity,&#x201D; a blank space, &#x201C;Average atomic mass (a m u),&#x201D; a blank space and &#x201C;Subtotal (a m u).&#x201D; The first column contains the symbols &#x201C;N a&#x201D;, &#x201C;C l,&#x201D; and a merged cell. The merged cell runs the length of the first five columns. The second column contains the numbers &#x201C;1&#x201D; and &#x201C;1&#x201D; as well as the merged cell. The third column contains the multiplication symbol in each cell except for the last, merged cell. The fourth column contains the numbers &#x201C;22.99&#x201D; and &#x201C;35.45&#x201D; as well as the merged cell. The fifth column contains the symbol &#x201C;=&#x201D; in each cell except for the last, merged cell. The sixth column contains the values &#x201C;22.99,&#x201D; &#x201C;35.45,&#x201D; and &#x201C;58.44.&#x201D; There is a thick black line below the number &#x201C;35.45.&#x201D; The merged cell under the first five columns reads &#x201C;Formula mass.&#x201D; To the left of the table is a diagram of a chemical structure. The diagram shows green and purple spheres placed in an alternating pattern, making up the corners of eight stacked cubes to form one larger cube. The green spheres are slightly smaller than the purple spheres.](../resources/CNX_Chem_03_01_saltMass.jpg "Table salt, NaCl, contains an array of sodium and chloride ions combined in a 1:1 ratio. Its formula mass is 58.44 amu."){: #CNX_Chem_03_01_saltMass}

Note that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than the masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing or additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The few exceptions to this guideline are very light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic masses.

### The Mole

The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the *mole*, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.

The mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of *the number* of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of matter. A **mole**{: data-type="term"} is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure <sup>12</sup>C weighing exactly 12 g. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.

The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be 6.02214179 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo></math>

 10<sup>23</sup>, a fundamental constant named **Avogadro’s number (*N<sub>A</sub>*)**{: data-type="term"} or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version being 6.022 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo></math>

 10<sup>23</sup>/mol.

Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The **molar mass**{: data-type="term"} of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_02_moles)).

 ![This figure contains eight different substances displayed on white circles. The amount of each substance is visibly different.](../resources/CNX_Chem_03_02_moles.jpg "Each sample contains 6.022 &#xD7; 1023 atoms &#x2014;1.00 mol of atoms. From left to right (top row): 65.4 g zinc, 12.0 g carbon, 24.3 g magnesium, and 63.5 g copper. From left to right (bottom row): 32.1 g sulfur, 28.1 g silicon, 207 g lead, and 118.7 g tin. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)"){: #CNX_Chem_03_02_moles}

Because the definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference substance, <sup>12</sup>C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition, a single <sup>12</sup>C atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). According to the definition of the mole, 12 g of <sup>12</sup>C contains 1 mole of <sup>12</sup>C atoms (its molar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic masses are measured relative to that of the amu-reference substance, <sup>12</sup>C. Extending this principle, the molar mass of a compound in grams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_02_compound)).

While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_02_water)). Although this represents just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (~18 g), it contains more water molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100 billion molecules.

The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadro’s number can be applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and calculate the substance’s mass.

<span data-type="title">Deriving Moles from Grams for an Element</span> According to nutritional guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture, the estimated average requirement for dietary potassium is 4.7 g. What is the estimated average requirement of potassium in moles?

<span data-type="title">Solution</span> The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is requested. Referring to the periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10 amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol. The given mass of K (4.7 g) is a bit more than one-tenth the molar mass (39.10 g), so a reasonable “ballpark” estimate of the number of moles would be slightly greater than 0.1 mol.

The molar amount of a substance may be calculated by dividing its mass (g) by its molar mass (g/mol):

<span data-type="media" data-alt="A diagram of two boxes connected by a right-facing arrow is shown. The box on the left contains the phrase, &#x201C;Mass of K atoms ( g )&#x201D; while the one on the right contains the phrase, &#x201C;Moles of K atoms ( mol ).&#x201D; There is a phrase under the arrow that says, &#x201C;Divide by molar mass (g / mol).&#x201D;"> ![A diagram of two boxes connected by a right-facing arrow is shown.

The factor-label method supports this mathematical approach since the unit “g” cancels and the answer has units of “mol:”

Counting Neurotransmitter Molecules in the Brain
</div>
The brain is the control center of the central nervous system ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_01_brain)). It sends and receives signals to and from muscles and other internal organs to monitor and control their functions; it processes stimuli detected by sensory organs to guide interactions with the external world; and it houses the complex physiological processes that give rise to our intellect and emotions. The broad field of neuroscience spans all aspects of the structure and function of the central nervous system, including research on the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN Initiative, a federal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through the concerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (more details available at www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative).

![Two pictures are shown. The left picture shows the human brain. The right picture is a microscopic image that depicts two large irregularly shaped masses in a field of threadlike material interspersed with smaller, relatively round masses. The two larger masses are labeled with arrows and the phrase &#x201C;Neuron cells.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_03_01_brain.jpg "(a) A typical human brain weighs about 1.5 kg and occupies a volume of roughly 1.1 L. (b) Information is transmitted in brain tissue and throughout the central nervous system by specialized cells called neurons (micrograph shows cells at 1600&#xD7; magnification)."){: #CNX_Chem_03_01_brain}


Specialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by way of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons when one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between the cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are stored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell wall and then break open to release their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_03_01_exocytosis)). One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Dopamine is involved in various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in the dopamine systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.

![Two diagrams are shown. In the upper left corner of the left diagram, an oval with a darkened center that has five short, branching appendages and one long tail-like appendage is shown and connected by an arrow to another image. This image depicts a close-up view of the oval section and its interaction with the tail-like portion of a similar structure. The close up view is composed of a narrow tube labeled &#x201C;neuron&#x201D; leading down to a bulbous base that holds thirteen circles filled with small dots. These circles are labeled &#x201C;vesicles.&#x201D; The base of the bulbous structure is next to a curved object labeled &#x201C;neuron&#x201D; and very small dots are emerging from the bulb&#x2019;s base and flowing toward the curved structure. The gap in between the two structures is labeled &#x201C;synapse,&#x201D; and the small dots are labeled &#x201C;neurotransmitters.&#x201D; The diagram on the right depicts a molecule composed of six black spheres connected by alternating double and single bonds in a hexagonal ring with other spheres attached to it. Three of the black spheres are connected to one smaller, white sphere each. Two of the black balls are connected to a smaller red sphere each. Each red sphere is connected to a smaller, white sphere. One black sphere is connected to another black sphere. It is connected to two smaller, white spheres and another black sphere. This second black sphere is connected to two smaller white spheres, and a slightly smaller blue sphere. The blue sphere is connected to two smaller, white spheres.](../resources/CNX_Chem_03_01_exocytosis.jpg "(a) Chemical signals are transmitted from neurons to other cells by the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the small gaps (synapses) between the cells. (b) Dopamine, C8H11NO2, is a neurotransmitter involved in a number of neurological processes."){: #CNX_Chem_03_01_exocytosis}


One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of neurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining neurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number changes with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to understand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules released—for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or a change in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle.

Significant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules stored in individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using miniaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have determined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine molecules per vesicle (about <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>5</mn><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>−20</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math>

 mol or 50 zmol). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to various drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in individual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These studies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting that it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical therapies.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref1">[1](#footnote1){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup>

### Key Concepts and Summary

The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each atom represented in the chemical formula and is expressed in atomic mass units. The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo></math>

 10<sup>23</sup>, a quantity called Avogadro’s number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass. Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance are numerically equivalent (for example, one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule weighs approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules weighs approximately 18 g).

We witness and utilize changes of physical state, or phase transitions, in a great number of ways. As one example of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation, freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state are essential aspects of our earth’s water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes of central importance to our lives. In this module, the essential aspects of phase transitions are explored.

### Vaporization and Condensation

When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas phase to the liquid is called **condensation**{: data-type="term"}. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of **vaporization**{: data-type="term"}, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be *in equilibrium* with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a **dynamic equilibrium**{: data-type="term"}, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example, vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the liquid’s **vapor pressure**{: data-type="term"} (or equilibrium vapor pressure). The area of the surface of the liquid in contact with a vapor and the size of the vessel have no effect on the vapor pressure, although they do affect the time required for the equilibrium to be reached. We can measure the vapor pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress1), and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the vapor in equilibrium with the condensed phase.

A horizontal line is drawn level with each of these liquid levels and the distance between the lines is labeled with a double-headed arrow. This section is labeled with the phrase, &#x201C;Vapor pressure.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress1.jpg "In a closed container, dynamic equilibrium is reached when (a) the rate of molecules escaping from the liquid to become the gas (b) increases and eventually (c) equals the rate of gas molecules entering the liquid. When this equilibrium is reached, the vapor pressure of the gas is constant, although the vaporization and condensation processes continue."){: #CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress1}

The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths) of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring “recapture” of gas-phase molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular attractive forces.

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<span data-type="title">Explaining Vapor Pressure in Terms of IMFs</span> Given the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative vapor pressures in terms of types and extents of IMFs:

</div>
<span data-type="title">Solution</span> Diethyl ether has a very small dipole and most of its intermolecular attractions are London forces. Although this molecule is the largest of the four under consideration, its IMFs are the weakest and, as a result, its molecules most readily escape from the liquid. It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller size, ethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding and, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the liquid at any given temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is much smaller than either of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive hydrogen bonding provides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and a lower vapor pressure than for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two −OH groups, so, like water, it exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger London forces. Its overall IMFs are the largest of these four substances, which means its vaporization rate will be the slowest and, consequently, its vapor pressure the lowest.

Answer:
</div>
All these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:* * *

As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress3). The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.

This line is labeled &#x201C;Low T.&#x201D; A second line, labeled &#x201C;High T,&#x201D; begins at the same point as the first, but does not go to such a high point, is wider, and ends slightly further to the right on the x-axis.](../resources/CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress3.jpg "Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, KE, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase."){: #CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress3}

### Boiling Points

When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The **boiling point**{: data-type="term"} of a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth’s atmosphere. The **normal boiling point**{: data-type="term"} of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress2) shows the variation in vapor pressure with temperature for several different substances. Considering the definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the dependence of a liquid’s boiling point on surrounding pressure.

 ![A graph is shown where the x-axis is labeled &#x201C;Temperature ( degree sign, C )&#x201D; and has values of 200 to 1000 in increments of 200 and the y-axis is labeled &#x201C;Pressure ( k P a )&#x201D; and has values of 20 to 120 in increments of 20. A horizontal dotted line extends across the graph at point 780 on the y-axis while three vertical dotted lines extend from points 35, 78, and 100 to meet the horizontal dotted line. Four lines are graphed. The first line, labeled &#x201C;ethyl ether,&#x201D; begins at the point &#x201C;0 , 200&#x201D; and extends in a slight curve to point &#x201C;45, 1000&#x201D; while the second line, labeled &#x201C;ethanol&#x201D;, extends from point &#x201C;0, 20&#x201D; to point &#x201C;88, 1000&#x201D; in a more extreme curve. The third line, labeled &#x201C;water,&#x201D; begins at the point &#x201C;0, 0&#x201D; and extends in a curve to point &#x201C;108, 1000&#x201D; while the fourth line, labeled &#x201C;ethylene glycol,&#x201D; extends from point &#x201C;80, 0&#x201D; to point &#x201C;140, 100&#x201D; in a very shallow curve.](../resources/CNX_Chem_10_03_VapPress2.jpg "The boiling points of liquids are the temperatures at which their equilibrium vapor pressures equal the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.

The quantitative relation between a substance’s vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the **Clausius-Clapeyron equation**{: data-type="term"}\:

<div data-type="equation">

</div>

where Δ*H*<sub>vap</sub> is the enthalpy of vaporization for the liquid, *R* is the gas constant, and ln *A* is a constant whose value depends on the chemical identity of the substance. This equation is often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation:

<div data-type="equation">

This linear equation may be expressed in a two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as demonstrated in the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T<sub>1</sub>, the vapor pressure is P<sub>1</sub>, and at temperature T<sub>2</sub>, the vapor pressure is T<sub>2</sub>, the corresponding linear equations are:

Since the constant, ln *A*, is the same, these two equations may be rearranged to isolate ln *A* and then set them equal to one another:

### Enthalpy of Vaporization

Vaporization is an endothermic process. The cooling effect can be evident when you leave a swimming pool or a shower. When the water on your skin evaporates, it removes heat from your skin and causes you to feel cold. The energy change associated with the vaporization process is the enthalpy of vaporization, Δ*H*<sub>vap</sub>. For example, the vaporization of water at standard temperature is represented by:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>O(</mtext><mi>l</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>O(</mtext><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="5em" /><mtext>Δ</mtext><msub><mi>H</mi><mrow><mtext>vap</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mtext>44.01 kJ/mol</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

As described in the chapter on thermochemistry, the reverse of an endothermic process is exothermic. And so, the condensation of a gas releases heat:

### Melting and Freezing

When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions and the solid gets hotter. At some point, the added energy becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of transitioning to the liquid state, or **melting**{: data-type="term"}. At this point, the temperature of the solid stops rising, despite the continual input of heat, and it remains constant until all of the solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued heating increase the temperature of the liquid ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_MeltingIce)).

 ![This figure shows four photos each labeled, &#x201C;a,&#x201D; &#x201C;b,&#x201D; &#x201C;c,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;d.&#x201D; Each photo shows a beaker with ice and a digital thermometer. The first photo shows ice cubes in the beaker, and the thermometer reads negative 12.0 degrees C. The second photo shows slightly melted ice, and the thermometer reads 0.0 degrees C. The third photo shows more water than ice in the beaker. The thermometer reads 0.0 degrees C. The fourth photo shows the ice completely melted, and the thermometer reads 22.2 degrees C.](../resources/CNX_Chem_10_03_MeltingIce.jpg "(a) This beaker of ice has a temperature of &#x2212;12.0 &#xB0;C. (b) After 10 minutes the ice has absorbed enough heat from the air to warm to 0 &#xB0;C. A small amount has melted. (c) Thirty minutes later, the ice has absorbed more heat, but its temperature is still 0 &#xB0;C. The ice melts without changing its temperature. (d) Only after all the ice has melted does the heat absorbed cause the temperature to increase to 22.2 &#xB0;C. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)"){: #CNX_Chem_10_03_MeltingIce}

If we stop heating during melting and place the mixture of solid and liquid in a perfectly insulated container so no heat can enter or escape, the solid and liquid phases remain in equilibrium. This is almost the situation with a mixture of ice and water in a very good thermos bottle; almost no heat gets in or out, and the mixture of solid ice and liquid water remains for hours. In a mixture of solid and liquid at equilibrium, the reciprocal processes of melting and **freezing**{: data-type="term"} occur at equal rates, and the quantities of solid and liquid therefore remain constant. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in equilibrium is called the **melting point**{: data-type="term"} of the solid or the **freezing point**{: data-type="term"} of the liquid. Use of one term or the other is normally dictated by the direction of the phase transition being considered, for example, solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).

The enthalpy of fusion and the melting point of a crystalline solid depend on the strength of the attractive forces between the units present in the crystal. Molecules with weak attractive forces form crystals with low melting points. Crystals consisting of particles with stronger attractive forces melt at higher temperatures.

The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid state to the liquid state is the enthalpy of fusion, ΔH<sub>fus</sub> of the substance. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.0 kJ/mol at 0 °C. Fusion (melting) is an endothermic process:

<div data-type="equation">

</div>

### Sublimation and Deposition

Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state, via a process known as **sublimation**{: data-type="term"}. At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO<sub>2</sub>) sublimes, appearing to gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting point of water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high altitudes. When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_Sublimtn)). The reverse of sublimation is called **deposition**{: data-type="term"}, a process in which gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.

 ![This figure shows a test tube. In the bottom is a dark substance which breaks up into a purple gas at the top.](../resources/CNX_Chem_10_03_Sublimtn.jpg "Sublimation of solid iodine in the bottom of the tube produces a purple gas that subsequently deposits as solid iodine on the colder part of the tube above. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)"){: #CNX_Chem_10_03_Sublimtn}

Like vaporization, the process of sublimation requires an input of energy to overcome intermolecular attractions. The enthalpy of sublimation, ΔH<sub>sub</sub>, is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance from the solid to the gaseous state. For example, the sublimation of carbon dioxide is represented by:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="5em" /><mtext>Δ</mtext><msub><mi>H</mi><mrow><mtext>sub</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mtext>26.1 kJ/mol</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

Likewise, the enthalpy change for the reverse process of deposition is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that for sublimation:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="5em" /><mtext>Δ</mtext><msub><mi>H</mi><mrow><mtext>dep</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mtext>−Δ</mtext><msub><mi>H</mi><mrow><mtext>sub</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>−26.1</mn><mspace width="0.2em" /><mtext>kJ/mol</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to achieve a given phase transition. Converting a solid into a liquid requires that these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous state requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion for a substance is less than its enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all phase changes for a given substance. Though not an entirely accurate description, sublimation may be conveniently modeled as a sequential two-step process of melting followed by vaporization in order to apply Hess’s Law. Viewed in this manner, the enthalpy of sublimation for a substance may be estimated as the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, as illustrated in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_PhaseChng). For example:

### Heating and Cooling Curves

In the chapter on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance, *q*, and its accompanying temperature change, Δ*T*, was introduced:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>c</mi><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>T</mi></mrow></math>
</div>

where *m* is the mass of the substance and *c* is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled, but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a change in state, its temperature remains constant. [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_10_03_HeatCurve) shows a typical heating curve.

Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the water’s temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state is in progress.

 ![A graph is shown where the x-axis is labeled &#x201C;Amount of heat added&#x201D; and the y-axis is labeled &#x201C;Temperature ( degree sign C )&#x201D; and has values of negative 10 to 100 in increments of 20. A right-facing horizontal arrow extends from point &#x201C;0, 0&#x201D; to the right side of the graph. A line graph begins at the lower left of the graph and moves to point &#x201C;0&#x201D; on the y-axis. This segment of the line is labeled &#x201C;H, subscript 2, O ( s ).&#x201D; The line then flattens and travels horizontally for a small distance. This segment is labeled &#x201C;Solid begins to melt&#x201D; on its left side and &#x201C;All solid melted&#x201D; on its right side. The line then goes steeply upward in a linear fashion until it hits point &#x201C;100&#x201D; on the y-axis. This segment of the line is labeled &#x201C;H, subscript 2, O,( l ).&#x201D; The line then flattens and travels horizontally for a moderate distance. This segment is labeled &#x201C;Liquid begins to boil&#x201D; on its left side and &#x201C;All liquid evaporated&#x201D; on its right side. The line then rises to a point above &#x201C;100&#x201D; on the y-axis.

### Key Concepts and Summary

Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another. There are six phase transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting, vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes, requiring an input of heat to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing, condensation, and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as intermolecular attractive forces are established or strengthened. The temperatures at which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of intermolecular attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance.

Why does spilled gasoline evaporate more rapidly on a hot day than on a cold day?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules of gasoline increases and so a greater fraction of molecules have sufficient energy to escape from the liquid than at lower temperatures.

Explain the following observations:

(a) It takes longer to cook an egg in Ft. Davis, Texas (altitude, 5000 feet above sea level) than it does in Boston (at sea level).

(b) Perspiring is a mechanism for cooling the body.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
(a) At 5000 feet, the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, and water will therefore boil at a lower temperature. This lower temperature will cause the physical and chemical changes involved in cooking the egg to proceed more slowly, and a longer time is required to fully cook the egg. (b) As long as the air surrounding the body contains less water vapor than the maximum that air can hold at that temperature, perspiration will evaporate, thereby cooling the body by removing the heat of vaporization required to vaporize the water.

The enthalpy of vaporization of CO<sub>2</sub>(*l*) is 9.8 kJ/mol. Would you expect the enthalpy of vaporization of CS<sub>2</sub>(*l*) to be 28 kJ/mol, 9.8 kJ/mol, or −8.4 kJ/mol? Discuss the plausibility of each of these answers.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The boiling point of CS<sub>2</sub> is higher than that of CO<sub>2</sub> partially because of the higher molecular weight of CS<sub>2</sub>; consequently, the attractive forces are stronger in CS<sub>2</sub>. It would be expected, therefore, that the heat of vaporization would be greater than that of 9.8 kJ/mol for CO<sub>2</sub>. A value of 28 kJ/mol would seem reasonable. A value of −8.4 kJ/mol would indicate a release of energy upon vaporization, which is clearly implausible.

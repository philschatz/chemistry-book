The largest database<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref1">[1](#footnote1){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup> of organic compounds lists about 10 million substances, which include compounds originating from living organisms and those synthesized by chemists. The number of potential organic compounds has been estimated<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="footnote-ref2">[2](#footnote2){: data-type="footnote-link"}</sup> at 10<sup>60</sup>—an astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic molecules is a consequence of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon atoms, resulting in chains and rings of many different sizes, shapes, and complexities.

The simplest **organic compounds**{: data-type="term"} contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called hydrocarbons. Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of hydrocarbons because they may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon atoms, or combinations of these structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon bonds present in their molecules. Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other hydrocarbons have been prepared in the laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as natural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. The familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish several types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding between carbon atoms. This leads to differences in geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals.

### Alkanes

**Alkanes**{: data-type="term"}, or **saturated hydrocarbons**{: data-type="term"}, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the carbon atoms in an alkane has *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either carbon or hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes). Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember that Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in the structural models (the ball-and-stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a straight line. Because of the *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridization, the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving such chains in an alkane a zigzag shape.

The structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by condensed structural formulas (or simply, *condensed formulas*). Instead of the usual format for chemical formulas in which each element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the bonding in the molecule. These formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of the bond symbols have been removed. Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at the bottom of [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes), and several additional examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this chapter.

 ![The figure illustrates four ways to represent molecules for molecules of methane, ethane, and pentane. In the first row of the figure, Lewis structural formulas show element symbols and bonds between atoms. Methane has a central C atom with four H atoms bonded to it. Ethane has a C atom with three H atoms bonded to it. The C atom is also bonded to another C atom with three H atoms bonded to it. Pentane has a C atom with three H atoms bonded to it. The C atom is bonded to another C atom with two H atoms bonded to it. The C atom is bonded to another C atom with two H atoms bonded to it. The C atom is bonded to another C atom with two H atoms bonded to it. The C atom is bonded to another C atom with three H atoms bonded to it. In the second row, ball-and-stick models are shown. In these representations, bonds are represented with sticks, and elements are represented with balls. Carbon atoms are black and hydrogen atoms are white in this image. In the third row, space-filling models are shown. In these models, atoms are enlarged and pushed together, without sticks to represent bonds. The molecule names and structural formulas are provided in the fourth row. Methane is named and represented with a condensed structural formula as C H subscript 4. Ethane is named and represented with two structural formulas C H subscript 3 C H subscript 3 and C subscript 2 H subscript 6. Pentane is named and represented as both C H subscript 3 C H subscript 2 C H subscript 2 C H subscript 2 C H subscript 3 and C subscript 5 H subscript 12.](../resources/CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes.jpg "Pictured are the Lewis structures, ball-and-stick models, and space-filling models for molecules of methane, ethane, and pentane."){: #CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes}

A common method used by organic chemists to simplify the drawings of larger molecules is to use a **skeletal structure**{: data-type="term"} (also called a line-angle structure). In this type of structure, carbon atoms are not symbolized with a C, but represented by each end of a line or bend in a line. Hydrogen atoms are not drawn if they are attached to a carbon. Other atoms besides carbon and hydrogen are represented by their elemental symbols. [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_LineStruct1) shows three different ways to draw the same structure.

 ![In this figure, a hydrocarbon molecule is shown in three ways. First, an expanded formula shows all individual carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and bonds in a branched hydrocarbon molecule. An initial C atom is bonded to three H atoms. The C atom is bonded to another C atom in the chain. This second C atom is bonded to one H atom and another C atom above the chain. The C atom bonded above the second C atom in the chain is bonded to three H atoms. The second C atom in the chain is bonded to a third C atom in the chain. This third C atom is bonded to on H atom and another C atom below the chain. This C atom is bonded to two H atoms and another C atom below the chain. This second C atom below the chain is bonded to three H atoms. The third C atom in the chain is bonded to a fourth C atom in the chain. The fourth C atom is bonded to two H atoms and a fifth C atom. The fifth C atom is bonded to two H atoms and a sixth C atom. The sixth C atom is bonded to three H atoms. Second, a condensed formula shows each carbon atom of the molecule in clusters with the hydrogen atoms bonded to it, leaving C H, C H subscript 2, and C H subscript 3 groups with bonds between them. The structure shows a C H subscript 3 group bonded to a C H group. The C H group is bonded above to a C H subscript 3 group. The C H group is also bonded to another C H group. This C H group is bonded to a C H subscript 2 group below and a C H subscript 3 group below that. This C H group is also bonded to a C H subscript 2 group which is bonded to another C H subscript 2 group. This C H subscript 2 group is bonded to a final C H subscript 2 group. The final structure in the figure is a skeletal structure which includes only line segments arranged to indicate the structure of the molecule.](../resources/CNX_Chem_20_01_LineStruct1.jpg "The same structure can be represented three different ways: an expanded formula, a condensed formula, and a skeletal structure."){: #CNX_Chem_20_01_LineStruct1}

All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas; noncyclic alkanes all have a formula of C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions (dispersion forces) and correspondingly different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point ([\[link\]](#fs-idp53743808)) usually change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change.

Hydrocarbons with the same formula, including alkanes, can have different structures. For example, two alkanes have the formula C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>\: They are called *n*-butane and 2-methylpropane (or isobutane), and have the following Lewis structures:

Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements of the atoms in their molecules. The *n*-butane molecule contains an *unbranched chain*, meaning that no carbon atom is bonded to more than two other carbon atoms. We use the term *normal*, or the prefix *n*, to refer to a chain of carbon atoms without branching. The compound 2–methylpropane has a branched chain (the carbon atom in the center of the Lewis structure is bonded to three other carbon atoms)

Identifying isomers from Lewis structures is not as easy as it looks. Lewis structures that look different may actually represent the same isomers. For example, the three structures in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_butane_img) all represent the same molecule, *n*-butane, and hence are not different isomers. They are identical because each contains an unbranched chain of four carbon atoms.

### The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (**IUPAC**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:

1.  To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in [\[link\]](#fs-idp53743808).
2.  Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of **substituents**{: data-type="term"}. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.

Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending *-o* replaces *-ide* at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with *-ide* like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the *-o* ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes *di-* (two), *tri-* (three), *tetra-* (four), and so on (for example, *difluoro-* indicates two fluoride substituents).

Some hydrocarbons can form more than one type of alkyl group when the hydrogen atoms that would be removed have different “environments” in the molecule. This diversity of possible alkyl groups can be identified in the following way: The four hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule are equivalent; they all have the same environment. They are equivalent because each is bonded to a carbon atom (the same carbon atom) that is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. (It may be easier to see the equivalency in the ball and stick models in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes). Removal of any one of the four hydrogen atoms from methane forms a methyl group. Likewise, the six hydrogen atoms in ethane are equivalent ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes)) and removing any one of these hydrogen atoms produces an ethyl group. Each of the six hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to two other hydrogen atoms and a carbon atom. However, in both propane and 2–methylpropane, there are hydrogen atoms in two different environments, distinguished by the adjacent atoms or groups of atoms:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="In this figure, propane is shown as a chain of three bonded C atoms.

The green hydrogen atom in 2-methylpropane differs from the other nine hydrogen atoms in that molecule and from the purple hydrogen atoms in propane. The green hydrogen atom in 2-methylpropane is bonded to a carbon atom bonded to three other carbon atoms. Two different alkyl groups can be formed from each of these molecules, depending on which hydrogen atom is removed. The names and structures of these and several other alkyl groups are listed in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_alkyls).

Alkanes burn in the presence of oxygen, a highly exothermic oxidation-reduction reaction that produces carbon dioxide and water. As a consequence, alkanes are excellent fuels. For example, methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is the principal component of natural gas. Butane, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, used in camping stoves and lighters is an alkane. Gasoline is a liquid mixture of continuous- and branched-chain alkanes, each containing from five to nine carbon atoms, plus various additives to improve its performance as a fuel. Kerosene, diesel oil, and fuel oil are primarily mixtures of alkanes with higher molecular masses. The main source of these liquid alkane fuels is crude oil, a complex mixture that is separated by fractional distillation. Fractional distillation takes advantage of differences in the boiling points of the components of the mixture (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_FracDistil)). You may recall that boiling point is a function of intermolecular interactions, which was discussed in the chapter on solutions and colloids.

 ![This figure contains a photo of a refinery, showing large columnar structures. A diagram of a fractional distillation column is also shown. Near the bottom of the column, an arrow pointing into the column from the left shows a point of entry for heated crude oil. The column contains several layers at which different components are removed. At the very bottom, residue materials are removed through a pipe as indicated by an arrow out of the column. At each successive level, different materials are removed through pipes proceeding from the bottom to the top of the column. In order from bottom to top, these materials are fuel oil, followed by diesel oil, kerosene, naptha, gasoline, and refinery gas at the very top.

### Alkenes

Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as unsaturated. You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains of carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules that contain one or more double bonds are called **alkenes**{: data-type="term"}. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond are bound together by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different geometry around the carbon atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular shape and properties. The differing geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated versus saturated fats.

Ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is the simplest alkene. Each carbon atom in ethene, commonly called ethylene, has a trigonal planar structure. The second member of the series is propene (propylene) ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_Propene1)); the butene isomers follow in the series. Four carbon atoms in the chain of butene allows for the formation of isomers based on the position of the double bond, as well as a new form of isomerism.

Ethylene (the common industrial name for ethene) is a basic raw material in the production of polyethylene and other important compounds. Over 135 million tons of ethylene were produced worldwide in 2010 for use in the polymer, petrochemical, and plastic industries. Ethylene is produced industrially in a process called cracking, in which the long hydrocarbon chains in a petroleum mixture are broken into smaller molecules.

Recycling Plastics
</div>
Polymers (from Greek words *poly* meaning “many” and *mer* meaning “parts”) are large molecules made up of repeating units, referred to as monomers. Polymers can be natural (starch is a polymer of sugar residues and proteins are polymers of amino acids) or synthetic \[like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene\]. The variety of structures of polymers translates into a broad range of properties and uses that make them integral parts of our everyday lives. Adding functional groups to the structure of a polymer can result in significantly different properties (see the discussion about Kevlar later in this chapter).

An example of a polymerization reaction is shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_Monomer). The monomer ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) is a gas at room temperature, but when polymerized, using a transition metal catalyst, it is transformed into a solid material made up of long chains of –CH<sub>2</sub>– units called polyethylene. Polyethylene is a commodity plastic used primarily for packaging (bags and films).

![This diagram has three rows, showing ethylene reacting to form polyethylene. In the first row, Lewis structural formulas show three molecules of ethylene being added together, which are each composed of two doubly bonded C atoms, each with two bonded H atoms. Ellipses, or three dots, are present before and after the molecule structures, which in turn are followed by an arrow pointing right. On the right side of the arrow, the ellipses or dots again appear to the left of a dash that connects to a chain of 7 C atoms, each with H atoms connected above and below. A dash appears at the end of the chain, which in turn is followed by ellipses or dots. The reaction diagram is repeated in the second row using ball-and-stick models for the structures. In these representations, single bonds are represented with sticks, double bonds are represented with two parallel sticks, and elements are represented with balls. Carbon atoms are black and hydrogen atoms are white in this image. In the third row, space-filling models are shown. In these models, atoms are enlarged spheres which are pushed together, without sticks to represent bonds.](../resources/CNX_Chem_20_01_monomer.jpg "The reaction for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene is shown."){: #CNX_Chem_20_01_Monomer}


Polyethylene is a member of one subset of synthetic polymers classified as plastics. Plastics are synthetic organic solids that can be molded; they are typically organic polymers with high molecular masses. Most of the monomers that go into common plastics (ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, and ethylene terephthalate) are derived from petrochemicals and are not very biodegradable, making them candidate materials for recycling. Recycling plastics helps minimize the need for using more of the petrochemical supplies and also minimizes the environmental damage caused by throwing away these nonbiodegradable materials.

Plastic recycling is the process of recovering waste, scrap, or used plastics, and reprocessing the material into useful products. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (soft drink bottles) can be melted down and used for plastic furniture, in carpets, or for other applications. Other plastics, like polyethylene (bags) and polypropylene (cups, plastic food containers), can be recycled or reprocessed to be used again. Many areas of the country have recycling programs that focus on one or more of the commodity plastics that have been assigned a recycling code (see [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_Recycle)). These operations have been in effect since the 1970s and have made the production of some plastics among the most efficient industrial operations today.

![This table shows recycling symbols, names, and uses of various types of plastics. Symbols are shown with three arrows in a triangular shape surrounding a number. Number 1 is labeled P E T E. The related plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (P E T E), is used in soda bottles and oven-ready food trays. Number 2 is labeled H D P E.

The name of an alkene is derived from the name of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. The presence of the double bond is signified by replacing the suffix *-ane* with the suffix *-ene*.** The location of the double bond** is identified by naming the smaller of the numbers of the carbon atoms participating in the double bond:

Molecules of 1-butene and 2-butene are structural isomers; the arrangement of the atoms in these two molecules differs. As an example of arrangement differences, the first carbon atom in 1-butene is bonded to two hydrogen atoms; the first carbon atom in 2-butene is bonded to three hydrogen atoms.

The compound 2-butene and some other alkenes also form a second type of isomer called a geometric isomer. In a set of geometric isomers, the same types of atoms are attached to each other in the same order, but the geometries of the two molecules differ. Geometric isomers of alkenes differ in the orientation of the groups on either side of a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>C</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math>

 bond.

Carbon atoms are free to rotate around a single bond but not around a double bond; a double bond is rigid. This makes it possible to have two isomers of 2-butene, one with both methyl groups on the same side of the double bond and one with the methyl groups on opposite sides. When structures of butene are drawn with 120°<sup /> bond angles around the *sp*<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms participating in the double bond, the isomers are apparent. The 2-butene isomer in which the two methyl groups are on the same side is called a *cis*-isomer; the one in which the two methyl groups are on opposite sides is called a *trans*-isomer ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_20_01_geoIsomers_img)). The different geometries produce different physical properties, such as boiling point, that may make separation of the isomers possible:

 ![The figure illustrates three ways to represent isomers of butene. In the first row of the figure, Lewis structural formulas show carbon and hydrogen element symbols and bonds between the atoms. The first structure in this row shows a C atom with a double bond to another C atom which is bonded down and to the right to C H subscript 2 which, in turn, is bonded to C H subscript 3. The first C atom, moving from left to right, has two H atoms bonded to it and the second C atom has one H atom bonded to it. The second structure in the row shows a C atom with a double bond to another C atom. The first C atom is bonded to an H atom up and to the left and C H subscript 3 down and to the left. The second C atom is bonded to an H atom up and to the right and C H subscript 3 down and to the right. Both C H subscript 3 structures appear in red. The third structure shows a C atom with a double bond to another C atom. The first C atom from the left is bonded up to a the left to C H subscript 3 which appears and red. It is also bonded down and to the left to an H atom. The second C atom is bonded up and to the right to an H atom and down and to the left to C H subscript 3 which appears in red. In the second row, ball-and-stick models for the structures are shown. In these representations, single bonds are represented with sticks, double bonds are represented with two parallel sticks, and elements are represented with balls. C atoms are black and H atoms are white in this image. In the third row, space-filling models are shown. In these models, atoms are enlarged and pushed together, without sticks to represent bonds.

The two molecules with the double bond between the second and third carbon atoms is called 2 dash butene.

Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes because the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>C</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math>

 moiety is a reactive functional group. A π bond, being a weaker bond, is disrupted much more easily than a σ bond. Thus, alkenes undergo a characteristic reaction in which the π bond is broken and replaced by two σ bonds. This reaction is called an **addition reaction**{: data-type="term"}. The hybridization of the carbon atoms in the double bond in an alkene changes from *sp*<sup>2</sup> to *sp*<sup>3</sup> during an addition reaction. For example, halogens add to the double bond in an alkene instead of replacing hydrogen, as occurs in an alkane:

### Alkynes

Hydrocarbon molecules with one or more triple bonds are called **alkynes**{: data-type="term"}; they make up another series of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Two carbon atoms joined by a triple bond are bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds. The *sp*-hybridized carbons involved in the triple bond have bond angles of 180°, giving these types of bonds a linear, rod-like shape.

The simplest member of the alkyne series is ethyne, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, commonly called acetylene. The Lewis structure for ethyne, a linear molecule, is:

Benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is the simplest member of a large family of hydrocarbons, called **aromatic hydrocarbons**{: data-type="term"}.

There are many derivatives of benzene. The hydrogen atoms can be replaced by many different substituents. Aromatic compounds more readily undergo substitution reactions than addition reactions; replacement of one of the hydrogen atoms with another substituent will leave the delocalized double bonds intact.

### Key Concepts and Summary

Strong, stable bonds between carbon atoms produce complex molecules containing chains, branches, and rings. The chemistry of these compounds is called organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen. The alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—that is, hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds. Alkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain ring structures with delocalized π electron systems.

On a microscopic level, how does the reaction of bromine with a saturated hydrocarbon differ from its reaction with an unsaturated hydrocarbon? How are they similar?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
Both reactions result in bromine being incorporated into the structure of the product. The difference is the way in which that incorporation takes place. In the saturated hydrocarbon, an existing C–H bond is broken, and a bond between the C and the Br can then be formed. In the unsaturated hydrocarbon, the only bond broken in the hydrocarbon is the π bond whose electrons can be used to form a bond to one of the bromine atoms in Br<sub>2</sub> (the electrons from the Br–Br bond form the other C–Br bond on the other carbon that was part of the π bond in the starting unsaturated hydrocarbon).

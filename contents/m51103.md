</div>

A balanced equation for a chemical reaction indicates what is reacting and what is produced, but it reveals nothing about how the reaction actually takes place. The **reaction mechanism**{: data-type="term"} (or reaction path) is the process, or pathway, by which a reaction occurs.

A chemical reaction usually occurs in steps, although it may not always be obvious to an observer. The decomposition of ozone, for example, appears to follow a mechanism with two steps:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>O</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>O</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mn>2</mn><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

We call each step in a reaction mechanism an **elementary reaction**{: data-type="term"}. Elementary reactions occur exactly as they are written and cannot be broken down into simpler steps. Elementary reactions add up to the overall reaction, which, for the decomposition, is:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mn>3</mn><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>
</div>

Notice that the oxygen atom produced in the first step of this mechanism is consumed in the second step and therefore does not appear as a product in the overall reaction. Species that are produced in one step and consumed in a subsequent step are called **intermediates**{: data-type="term"}.

While the overall reaction equation for the decomposition of ozone indicates that two molecules of ozone react to give three molecules of oxygen, the mechanism of the reaction does not involve the collision and reaction of two ozone molecules. Rather, it involves a molecule of ozone decomposing to an oxygen molecule and an intermediate oxygen atom; the oxygen atom then reacts with a second ozone molecule to give two oxygen molecules. These two elementary reactions occur exactly as they are shown in the reaction mechanism.

### Unimolecular Elementary Reactions

The **molecularity**{: data-type="term"} of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant species (atoms, molecules, or ions). For example, a **unimolecular reaction**{: data-type="term"} involves the rearrangement of a *single* reactant species to produce one or more molecules of product:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mtext>products</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

The rate equation for a unimolecular reaction is:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></math>
</div>

A unimolecular reaction may be one of several elementary reactions in a complex mechanism. For example, the reaction:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mtext>O</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

illustrates a unimolecular elementary reaction that occurs as one part of a two-step reaction mechanism. However, some unimolecular reactions may have only a single reaction in the reaction mechanism. (In other words, an elementary reaction can also be an overall reaction in some cases.) For example, the gas-phase decomposition of cyclobutane, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, to ethylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, occurs via a unimolecular, single-step mechanism:

<div data-type="media" data-alt="In this figure, structural formulas are used to illustrate a chemical reaction. On the left, a structural formula for cyclobutane is shown. This structure is composed of 4 C atoms connected with single bonds in a square shape. Each C atom is bonded to two other C atoms in the structure, leaving two bonds for H atoms pointing outward above, below, left, and right. An arrow points right to two identical ethane molecules with a plus symbol between them. Each of these molecules contains two C atoms connected with a double bond oriented vertically between them. The C atom at the top of these molecules has H atoms bonded above to the right and left. Similarly, the lower C atom has two H atoms bonded below to the right and left.">

</div>

For these unimolecular reactions to occur, all that is required is the separation of parts of single reactant molecules into products.

Chemical bonds do not simply fall apart during chemical reactions. Energy is required to break chemical bonds. The activation energy for the decomposition of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, for example, is 261 kJ per mole. This means that it requires 261 kilojoules to distort one mole of these molecules into activated complexes that decompose into products:

In a sample of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, a few of the rapidly moving C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecules collide with other rapidly moving molecules and pick up additional energy. When the C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecules gain enough energy, they can transform into an activated complex, and the formation of ethylene molecules can occur. In effect, a particularly energetic collision knocks a C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecule into the geometry of the activated complex. However, only a small fraction of gas molecules travel at sufficiently high speeds with large enough kinetic energies to accomplish this. Hence, at any given moment, only a few molecules pick up enough energy from collisions to react.

The rate of decomposition of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> is directly proportional to its concentration. Doubling the concentration of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> in a sample gives twice as many molecules per liter. Although the fraction of molecules with enough energy to react remains the same, the total number of such molecules is twice as great. Consequently, there is twice as much C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> per liter, and the reaction rate is twice as fast:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mtext>C</mtext><mn>4</mn></msub><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>8</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.1em" /><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mtext>C</mtext><mn>4</mn></msub><msub><mtext>H</mtext><mn>8</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></math>
</div>

A similar relationship applies to any unimolecular elementary reaction; the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the reaction exhibits first-order behavior. The proportionality constant is the rate constant for the particular unimolecular reaction.

### Bimolecular Elementary Reactions

The collision and combination of two molecules or atoms to form an activated complex in an elementary reaction is called a **bimolecular reaction**{: data-type="term"}. There are two types of bimolecular elementary reactions:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mi>A</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mtext>products</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>and</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mn>2</mn><mi>A</mi><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mtext>products</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

For the first type, in which the two reactant molecules are different, the rate law is first-order in *A* and first order in *B*\:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></math>
</div>

For the second type, in which two identical molecules collide and react, the rate law is second order in *A*\:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>A</mi><msup><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></math>
</div>

Some chemical reactions have mechanisms that consist of a single bimolecular elementary reaction. One example is the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide:

<div data-type="equation">

 ![This figure provides an illustration of a reaction between two H I molecules using space filling models. H atoms are shown as white spheres, and I atoms are shown as purple spheres.

Bimolecular elementary reactions may also be involved as steps in a multistep reaction mechanism. The reaction of atomic oxygen with ozone is one example:

<div data-type="equation">

</div>

### Termolecular Elementary Reactions

An elementary **termolecular reaction**{: data-type="term"} involves the simultaneous collision of three atoms, molecules, or ions. Termolecular elementary reactions are uncommon because the probability of three particles colliding simultaneously is less than one one-thousandth of the probability of two particles colliding. There are, however, a few established termolecular elementary reactions. The reaction of nitric oxide with oxygen appears to involve termolecular steps:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>2NO</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mn>2</mn><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

Likewise, the reaction of nitric oxide with chlorine appears to involve termolecular steps:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>2NO</mtext><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>Cl</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mn>2</mn><mtext>NOCl</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><msup><mrow><mtext>[NO]</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mrow><mtext>Cl</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

### Relating Reaction Mechanisms to Rate Laws

It\'s often the case that one step in a multistep reaction mechanism is significantly slower than the others. Because a reaction cannot proceed faster than its slowest step, this step will limit the rate at which the overall reaction occurs. The slowest step is therefore called the **rate-limiting step**{: data-type="term"} (or rate-determining step) of the reaction [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_12_06_Cattle).

 ![A photo is shown of cattle passing through a narrow chute into a holding pen. A person directs them through the gate with a long white and red pole.](../resources/CNX_Chem_12_06_Cattle.jpg "A cattle chute is a nonchemical example of a rate-determining step. Cattle can only be moved from one holding pen to another as quickly as one animal can make its way through the chute. (credit: Loren Kerns)"){: #CNX_Chem_12_06_Cattle}

As described earlier, rate laws may be derived directly from the chemical equations for elementary reactions. This is not the case, however, for ordinary chemical reactions. The balanced equations most often encountered represent the overall change for some chemical system, and very often this is the result of some multistep reaction mechanisms. In every case, we must determine the overall rate law from experimental data and deduce the mechanism from the rate law (and sometimes from other data). The reaction of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO provides an illustrative example:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>CO</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>
</div>

For temperatures above 225 °C, the rate law has been found to be:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>
</div>

The reaction is first order with respect to NO<sub>2</sub> and first-order with respect to CO. This is consistent with a single-step bimolecular mechanism and it is *possible* that this is the mechanism for this reaction at high temperatures.

At temperatures below 225 °C*,* the reaction is described by a rate law that is second order with respect to NO<sub>2</sub>\:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><msup><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math>
</div>

This is consistent with a mechanism that involves the following two elementary reactions, the first of which is slower and is therefore the rate-determining step:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mtext>slow</mtext></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>CO</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>NO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>CO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mtext>fast</mtext></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

The rate-determining step gives a rate law showing second-order dependence on the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and the sum of the two equations gives the net overall reaction.

In general, when the rate-determining (slower) step is the first step in a mechanism, the rate law for the overall reaction is the same as the rate law for this step. However, when the rate-determining step is preceded by a step involving an *equilibrium* reaction, the rate law for the overall reaction may be more difficult to derive.

An elementary reaction is at equilibrium when it proceeds in both the forward and reverse directions at equal rates. Consider the dimerization of NO to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with *k*<sub>1</sub> used to represent the rate constant of the forward reaction and *k*<sub>-1</sub> used to represent the rate constant of the reverse reaction:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>NO</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo stretchy="false">⇌</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><msub><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>rate</mtext><mrow><mtext>forward</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mtext>rate</mtext><mrow><mtext>reverse</mtext></mrow></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><msup><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mrow><mn>−1</mn></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
</div>

If N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was an intermediate in a mechanism, this expression could be rearranged to represent the concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the overall rate law expression using algebraic manipulation:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mtext>k</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mtext>NO</mtext><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><msub><mtext>k</mtext><mrow><mn>−1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>
</div>

However, once again, intermediates cannot be listed as part of the overall rate law expression, though they can be included in an individual elementary reaction of a mechanism. [\[link\]](#fs-idp252983408) will illustrate how to derive overall rate laws from mechanisms involving equilibrium steps preceding the rate-determining step.

Next, write the rate law expression for each elementary reaction. Remember that for elementary reactions that are part of a mechanism, the rate law expression can be derived directly from the stoichiometry:

The third step, which is the slow step, is the rate-determining step. Therefore, the overall rate law expression could be written as Rate = *k*<sub>3</sub> \[NOCl\]\[ClO\]. However, both NOCl and ClO are intermediates. Algebraic expressions must be used to represent \[NOCl\] and \[ClO\] such that no intermediates remain in the overall rate law expression.

### Key Concepts and Summary

The sequence of individual steps, or elementary reactions, by which reactants are converted into products during the course of a reaction is called the reaction mechanism. The overall rate of a reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest step, called the rate-determining step. Unimolecular elementary reactions have first-order rate laws, while bimolecular elementary reactions have second-order rate laws. By comparing the rate laws derived from a reaction mechanism to that determined experimentally, the mechanism may be deemed either incorrect or plausible.

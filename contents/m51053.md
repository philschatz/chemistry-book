Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules. However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and relative arrangements in space ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_CH2O)). A **bond angle**{: data-type="term"} is the angle between any two bonds that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A **bond distance**{: data-type="term"} (or bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in Ångstroms (1 Å = 10<sup>–10</sup> m) or picometers (1 pm = 10<sup>–12</sup> m, 100 pm = 1 Å).

### VSEPR Theory

**Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory)**{: data-type="term"} enables us to predict the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.

VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.

As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous BeF<sub>2</sub> molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF<sub>2</sub> ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2)) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The bond angle is 180° ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2)).

 ![A Lewis structure is shown. A fluorine atom with three lone pairs of electrons is single bonded to a beryllium atom which is single bonded to a fluorine atom with three lone pairs of electrons. The angle of the bonds between the two fluorine atoms and the beryllium atom is labeled, &#x201C;180 degrees.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2.jpg "The BeF2 molecule adopts a linear structure in which the two bonds are as far apart as possible, on opposite sides of the Be atom."){: #CNX_Chem_07_06_BeF2}

[\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom) illustrates this and other electron-pair geometries that minimize the repulsions among regions of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Two regions of electron density around a central atom in a molecule form a **linear**{: data-type="term"} geometry; three regions form a **trigonal planar**{: data-type="term"} geometry; four regions form a **tetrahedral**{: data-type="term"} geometry; five regions form a **trigonal bipyramidal**{: data-type="term"} geometry; and six regions form an **octahedral**{: data-type="term"} geometry.

#### Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure

It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is *not* the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom) describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the *atoms*, not the electrons.

We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes *all* electron pairs the **electron-pair geometry**{: data-type="term"}. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the **molecular structure**{: data-type="term"}. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom.

For example, the methane molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_CH4)). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH<sub>3</sub>, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3)).

 ![A Lewis structure shows a carbon atom single bonded to four hydrogen atoms. This structure uses wedges and dashes to give it a three dimensional appearance.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_06_CH4.jpg "The molecular structure of the methane molecule, CH4, is shown with a tetrahedral arrangement of the hydrogen atoms. VSEPR structures like this one are often drawn using the wedge and dash notation, in which solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the page, solid wedges represent bonds coming up out of the plane, and dashed lines represent bonds going down into the plane."){: #CNX_Chem_07_06_CH4}

![Three images are shown and labeled, &#x201C;a,&#x201D; &#x201C;b,&#x201D; and &#x201C;c.&#x201D; Image a shows a nitrogen atom single bonded to three hydrogen atoms. There are four oval-shaped orbs that surround each hydrogen and one facing away from the rest of the molecule. These orbs are located in a tetrahedral arrangement. Image b shows a ball-and-stick model of the nitrogen single bonded to the three hydrogen atoms. Image c is the same as image a, but there are four curved, double headed arrows that circle the molecule and are labeled, &#x201C;106.8 degrees.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3.jpg "(a) The electron-pair geometry for the ammonia molecule is tetrahedral with one lone pair and three single bonds. (b) The trigonal pyramidal molecular structure is determined from the electron-pair geometry. (c) The actual bond angles deviate slightly from the idealized angles because the lone pair takes up a larger region of space than do the single bonds, causing the HNH angle to be slightly smaller than 109.5&#xB0;."){: #CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3}

As seen in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3), small distortions from the ideal angles in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom) can result from differences in repulsion between various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest to least repulsion is:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>lone pair-lone pair</mtext><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>lone pair-bonding pair</mtext><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>bonding pair-bonding pair</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:

<div data-type="equation">

</div>

Consider formaldehyde, H<sub>2</sub>CO, which is used as a preservative for biological and anatomical specimens ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_CH2O)). This molecule has regions of high electron density that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal planar with 120° bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger angles (121°), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118°).

In the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal planar molecular structure, but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramid ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3)) with the nitrogen atom at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal pyramid are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than do bonding electrons. The H–N–H bond angles in NH<sub>3</sub> are slightly smaller than the 109.5° angle in a regular tetrahedron ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom)) because the lone pair-bonding pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3)). [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom) illustrates the ideal molecular structures, which are predicted based on the electron-pair geometries for various combinations of lone pairs and bonding pairs.

For a particular number of electron pairs (row), the molecular structures for one or more lone pairs are determined based on modifications of the corresponding electron-pair geometry."){: #CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom}

According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom)) are equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Axeq)\: an **axial position**{: data-type="term"} (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an **equatorial position**{: data-type="term"} (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom), the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of 90°, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the 120° bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.

Theoretically, we can come up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF<sub>3</sub> molecule ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Axeq)). The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial locations, giving a T-shaped molecular structure.

 ![Four sets of images are shown and labeled, &#x201C;a,&#x201D; &#x201C;b,&#x201D; &#x201C;c,&#x201D; and &#x201C;d.&#x201D; Each image is separated by a dashed vertical line.

When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an octahedral electron-pair geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the octahedron (180° apart), giving a square planar molecular structure that minimizes lone pair-lone pair repulsions ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom)).

#### Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure

The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and the molecular structures:

1.  Write the Lewis structure of the molecule or polyatomic ion.
2.  Count the number of regions of electron density (lone pairs and bonds) around the central atom. A single, double, or triple bond counts as one region of electron density.
3.  Identify the electron-pair geometry based on the number of regions of electron density: linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom), first column).
4.  Use the number of lone pairs to determine the molecular structure ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom)). If more than one arrangement of lone pairs and chemical bonds is possible, choose the one that will minimize repulsions, remembering that lone pairs occupy more space than multiple bonds, which occupy more space than single bonds. In trigonal bipyramidal arrangements, repulsion is minimized when every lone pair is in an equatorial position. In an octahedral arrangement with two lone pairs, repulsion is minimized when the lone pairs are on opposite sides of the central atom.

The following examples illustrate the use of VSEPR theory to predict the molecular structure of molecules or ions that have no lone pairs of electrons. In this case, the molecular structure is identical to the electron pair geometry.

This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atom—each double bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180°. The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are linear.

(b) We write the Lewis structure of BCl<sub>3</sub> as:

Thus we see that BCl<sub>3</sub> contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The B–Cl bonds lie in a plane with 120° angles between them. BCl<sub>3</sub> also has a trigonal planar molecular structure ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_BCl3mol)).

The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of BCl<sub>3</sub> are both trigonal planar. Note that the VSEPR geometry indicates the correct bond angles (120°), unlike the Lewis structure shown above.

#### Molecular Structure for Multicenter Molecules

When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms that each possess a “local” geometry. The way these local structures are oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local structures.

### Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment

As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (δ+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (δ–), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a **bond dipole moment**{: data-type="term"}. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (*µ*) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi fontstyle="italic">μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mtext>Qr</mtext></mrow></math>
</div>

This bond moment can be represented as a **vector**{: data-type="term"}, a quantity having both direction and magnitude ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_BondVector)). Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.

 ![Two images are shown and labeled, &#x201C;a&#x201D; and &#x201C;b.&#x201D; Image a shows a large sphere labeled, &#x201C;C,&#x201D; a left-facing arrow with a crossed end, and a smaller sphere labeled &#x201C;H.&#x201D; Image b shows a large sphere labeled, &#x201C;B,&#x201D; a right-facing arrow with a crossed end, and a smaller sphere labeled &#x201C;F.&#x201D;](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_06_BondVector.jpg "(a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H, represented as a short vector. (b) The electronegativity difference between B and F is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is much longer."){: #CNX_Chem_07_06_BondVector}

A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a **polar molecule**{: data-type="term"} (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The **dipole moment**{: data-type="term"} measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.

For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.

When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO<sub>2</sub> ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip)). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip)), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).

The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO<sub>2</sub>, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:

Although C and S have very similar electronegativity values, S is slightly more electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the molecule is the negative end.

Chloromethane, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the polar C–Cl and C–H bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the C–Cl bonds have a larger bond moment than the C–H bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each other. All of the dipoles have an upward component in the orientation shown, since carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine:

#### Properties of Polar Molecules

Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive end of the molecule oriented toward the negative plate and the negative end toward the positive plate ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_06_Dipolfield)). We can use an electrically charged object to attract polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at dissolving nonpolar substances.

The largest bond moments will occur with the largest partial charges. The two solutions above represent how unevenly the electrons are shared in the bond. The bond moments will be maximized when the electronegativity difference is greatest. The controls for A and C should be set to one extreme, and B should be set to the opposite extreme. Although the magnitude of the bond moment will not change based on whether B is the most electronegative or the least, the direction of the bond moment will.

### Key Concepts and Summary

VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.

### Glossary
{: data-type="glossary-title"}

axial position
: location in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in which there is another atom at a 180° angle and the equatorial positions are at a 90° angle
^

bond angle
: angle between any two covalent bonds that share a common atom
^

bond distance
: (also, bond length) distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms
^

bond dipole moment
: separation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector
^

dipole moment
: property of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure
^

electron-pair geometry
: arrangement around a central atom of all regions of electron density (bonds, lone pairs, or unpaired electrons)
^

equatorial position
: one of the three positions in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with 120° angles between them; the axial positions are located at a 90° angle
^

linear
: shape in which two outside groups are placed on opposite sides of a central atom
^

molecular structure
: structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule

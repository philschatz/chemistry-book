</div>

The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of σ and π bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="A Lewis structure is shown in which two carbon atoms are bonded together by a double bond. Each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms by a single bond."> ![A Lewis structure is shown in which two carbon atoms are bonded together by a double bond. Each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms by a single bond.](../resources/CNX_Chem_08_03_C4H4Lewis_img.jpg) </span> The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the σ bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2*p* orbitals and the 2*s* orbital ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_sp3config)). These orbitals form the C–H single bonds and the σ bond in the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>C</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math>

 double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2*p* orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized *p* orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_C2H4orbit)) is perpendicular to the plane of the *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2*p* orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_C2H4orbit)) and form a π bond*.*

Four C&#x2013;H bonds result from the overlap between the C atoms' sp2 orbitals with s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. (b) The &#x3C0; bond is formed by the side-by-side overlap of the two unhybridized p orbitals in the two carbon atoms. The two lobes of the &#x3C0; bond are above and below the plane of the &#x3C3; system."){: #CNX_Chem_08_03_C2H4orbit}

In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two planes of *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the *p* orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the π bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between σ and π bonds; rotation around single (σ) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the σ bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the π bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the π bond.

In molecules with *sp* hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized *p* orbitals remain on the atom ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_spC)). We find this situation in acetylene, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>H−C≡C−H</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>

 which is a linear molecule. The *sp* hybrid orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a σ bond between the carbon atoms ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_C2H2)). The remaining *sp* orbitals form σ bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized *p* orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence, form two π bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds, giving a triple bond.

Hybridization involves only σ bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of π bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of π bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of hybridization.

For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_03_C6H6)). We can use either of these forms to determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization is *sp*<sup>2</sup>. The electrons in the unhybridized *p* orbitals form π bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes the electrons in the π bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by molecular orbital theory. (See the next module.)

 ![A diagram is shown that is made up of two Lewis structures connected by a double ended arrow. The left image shows six carbon atoms bonded together with alternating double and single bonds to form a six-sided ring. Each carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen atom by a single bond. The right image shows the same structure, but the double and single bonds in between the carbon atoms have changed positions.](../resources/CNX_Chem_08_03_C6H6.jpg "Each carbon atom in benzene, C6H6, is sp2 hybridized, independently of which resonance form is considered.

### Key Concepts and Summary

Multiple bonds consist of a σ bond located along the axis between two atoms and one or two π bonds. The σ bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized atomic orbitals, while the π bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of π bonds can vary.

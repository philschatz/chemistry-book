Thus far in this chapter, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between atoms and/or ions. In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence shell electrons between atoms. In this section, we will explore the typical method for depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbols and Lewis structures.

### Lewis Symbols

We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic ions. A **Lewis symbol**{: data-type="term"} consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of its valence electrons:

A lone pair of electrons are shown to the right of the symbol.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_03_Lewisstruct1_img.jpg) </span> [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_03_3rowLewis) shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the periodic table.

### Lewis Structures

We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in **Lewis structures**{: data-type="term"}, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="A Lewis dot diagram shows a reaction. Two chlorine symbols, each surrounded by seven dots are separated by a plus sign. The dots on the first atom are all black and the dots on the second atom are all read. The phrase, &#x201C;Chlorine atoms&#x201D; is written below. A right-facing arrow points to two chlorine symbols, each with six dots surrounding their outer edges and a shared pair of dots in between. One of the shared dots is black and one is red. The phrase, &#x201C;Chlorine molecule&#x201D; is written below."> ![A Lewis dot diagram shows a reaction. Two chlorine symbols, each surrounded by seven dots are separated by a plus sign.

A right-facing arrow points to two chlorine symbols, each with six dots surrounding their outer edges and a shared pair of dots in between. One of the shared dots is black and one is red. The phrase, &#x201C;Chlorine molecule&#x201D; is written below.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_03_C12dot_img.jpg) </span> The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called **lone pairs**{: data-type="term"}) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line) is sometimes used to indicate a shared pair of electrons:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="Two Lewis structures are shown. The left-hand structure shows two H atoms connected by a single bond. The right-hand structure shows two C l atoms connected by a single bond and each surrounded by six dots."> ![Two Lewis structures are shown. The left-hand structure shows two H atoms connected by a single bond. The right-hand structure shows two C l atoms connected by a single bond and each surrounded by six dots.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_03_Cl2dash_img.jpg) </span> A single shared pair of electrons is called a **single bond**{: data-type="term"}. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond.

#### The Octet Rule

The other halogen molecules (F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and At<sub>2</sub>) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the **octet rule**{: data-type="term"}.

The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH<sub>4</sub> (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="Two sets of Lewis dot structures are shown. The left structures depict five C l symbols in a cross shape with eight dots around each, the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; and the same five C l symbols, connected by four single bonds in a cross shape.

To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="Three Lewis structures labeled, &#x201C;Ammonia,&#x201D; &#x201C;Water,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hydrogen fluoride&#x201D; are shown.

As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A **double bond**{: data-type="term"} forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms, as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in CH<sub>2</sub>O (formaldehyde) and between the two carbon atoms in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (ethylene):

For very simple molecules and molecular ions, we can write the Lewis structures by merely pairing up the unpaired electrons on the constituent atoms. See these examples:

The second reaction shows a hydrogen with a coefficient of two and one red dot, a plus sign, and a sulfur atom with six dots, two of which are red, connected by a right facing arrow to two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom. There are two red dots in between the two hydrogen atoms and the sulfur atom. Both pairs of these dots are red. The sulfur atom also has two lone pairs of dots. The third reaction shows two nitrogen atoms each with five dots, three of which are red, separated by a plus sign, and connected by a right-facing arrow to two nitrogen atoms with six red electron dots in between one another. Each nitrogen atom also has one lone pair of electrons."> ![Three reactions are shown with Lewis dot diagrams.

1.  Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. For cations, subtract one electron for each positive charge. For anions, add one electron for each negative charge.
2.  Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule or ion, arranging the atoms around a central atom. (Generally, the least electronegative element should be placed in the center.) Connect each atom to the central atom with a single bond (one electron pair).
3.  Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms (except hydrogen), completing an octet around each atom.
4.  Place all remaining electrons on the central atom.
5.  Rearrange the electrons of the outer atoms to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain octets wherever possible.

In 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard **Smalley**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_03_Smalley)), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the C<sub>60</sub> buckminsterfullerene molecule ([\[link\]](/m51046#CNX_Chem_07_00_Bucky)). An entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on C<sub>60.</sub> This type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems. They also possess unique electronic and optical properties that have been put to good use in solar powered devices and chemical sensors.

### Exceptions to the Octet Rule

Many covalent molecules have central atoms that do not have eight electrons in their Lewis structures. These molecules fall into three categories:

* Odd-electron molecules have an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore have an unpaired electron.
* Electron-deficient molecules have a central atom that has fewer electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.
* Hypervalent molecules have a central atom that has more electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.
{: data-bullet-style="bullet"}

#### Odd-electron Molecules

We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons **free radicals**{: data-type="term"}. Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high temperatures.

To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for other molecules, but with a few minor changes:

1.  *Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons*. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N) + 6 (from O) = 11. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell.
2.  *Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule*. We can easily draw a skeleton with an N–O single bond:
    * * *
    {: data-type="newline"}
    
    N–O
3.  *Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms*. In this case, there is no central atom, so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell:
    * * *
    {: data-type="newline"}
    
    <span data-type="media" data-alt="A Lewis structure shows a nitrogen atom, with one lone pair and one lone electron single bonded to an oxygen atom with three lone pairs of electrons."> ![A Lewis structure shows a nitrogen atom, with one lone pair and one lone electron single bonded to an oxygen atom with three lone pairs of electrons.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_03_NOsingle_img.jpg) </span>
4.  *Place all remaining electrons on the central atom*. Since there are no remaining electrons, this step does not apply.
5.  *Rearrange the electrons to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain octets wherever possible.* We know that an odd-electron molecule cannot have an octet for every atom, but we want to get each atom as close to an octet as possible. In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move closer to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond. (We cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen would then have nine electrons:)

#### Electron-deficient Molecules

We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>, and boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in BF<sub>3</sub>, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B–F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B–F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However, the B–F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B–F single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule.

<span data-type="media" data-alt="Two Lewis structures are shown. The left shows a beryllium atom single bonded to two hydrogen atoms.

The left shows a beryllium atom single bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The right shows a boron atom single bonded to three fluorine atoms, each with three lone pairs of electrons.](../resources/CNX_Chem_07_03_edeficient_img.jpg) </span> An atom like the boron atom in BF<sub>3</sub>, which does not have eight electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH<sub>3</sub> reacts with BF<sub>3</sub> because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the boron atom:

Elements in the second period of the periodic table (*n* = 2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because they have only four valence orbitals (one 2*s* and three 2*p* orbitals). Elements in the third and higher periods (*n* ≥ 3) have more than four valence orbitals and can share more than four pairs of electrons with other atoms because they have empty *d* orbitals in the same shell. Molecules formed from these elements are sometimes called **hypervalent molecules**{: data-type="term"}. [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_07_03_PF5SF6_img) shows the Lewis structures for two hypervalent molecules, PCl<sub>5</sub> and SF<sub>6.</sub>

 ![Two Lewis structures are shown. The left shows a phosphorus atom single bonded to five chlorine atoms, each with three lone pairs of electrons.

In SF6, sulfur shares six pairs of electrons."){: #CNX_Chem_07_03_PF5SF6_img}

In some hypervalent molecules, such as IF<sub>5</sub> and XeF<sub>4</sub>, some of the electrons in the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="Two Lewis structures are shown. The left shows an iodine atom with one lone pair single bonded to five fluorine atoms, each with three lone pairs of electrons.

### Key Concepts and Summary

Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most structures—especially those containing second row elements—obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.

double bond
: covalent bond in which two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms
^

free radical
: molecule that contains an odd number of electrons
^

hypervalent molecule
: molecule containing at least one main group element that has more than eight electrons in its valence shell
^

Lewis structure
: diagram showing lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons in a molecule or an ion
^

Lewis symbol
: symbol for an element or monatomic ion that uses a dot to represent each valence electron in the element or ion
^

lone pair
: two (a pair of) valence electrons that are not used to form a covalent bond
^

octet rule
: guideline that states main group atoms will form structures in which eight valence electrons interact with each nucleus, counting bonding electrons as interacting with both atoms connected by the bond
^

single bond
: bond in which a single pair of electrons is shared between two atoms
^

triple bond
: bond in which three pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms

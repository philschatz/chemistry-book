In 1824, at the age of 28, Nicolas Léonard Sadi **Carnot**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_16_03_Carnot)) published the results of an extensive study regarding the efficiency of steam heat engines. In a later review of Carnot’s findings, Rudolf **Clausius**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} introduced a new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to the temperature at which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the *reversible* heat (*q*<sub>rev</sub>) and the kelvin temperature (*T*). The term **reversible process**{: data-type="term"} refers to a process that takes place at such a slow rate that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be “reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change is some condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a formalism required to support the development of various thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are truly reversible, rather they are classified as *irreversible*.

 ![ A portrait of Rudolf Clasius is shown.](../resources/CNX_Chem_16_03_Carnot.jpg "(a) Nicholas L&#xE9;onard Sadi Carnot&#x2019;s research into steam-powered machinery and (b) Rudolf Clausius&#x2019;s later study of those findings led to groundbreaking discoveries about spontaneous heat flow processes."){: #CNX_Chem_16_03_Carnot}

Similar to other thermodynamic properties, this new quantity is a state function, and so its change depends only upon the initial and final states of a system. In 1865, Clausius named this property **entropy (*S*)**{: data-type="term"} and defined its change for any process as the following:

<div data-type="equation" class="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mrow><mtext>rev</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>
</div>

The entropy change for a real, irreversible process is then equal to that for the theoretical reversible process that involves the same initial and final states.

# Entropy and Microstates

Following the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig **Boltzmann**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of *microstates* possible for the system. A **microstate (*W*)**{: data-type="term"} is a specific configuration of the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that comprise a system like the following:

<div data-type="equation" class="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mspace width="0.2em" /><mtext>ln</mtext><mspace width="0.2em" /><mi>W</mi></mrow></math>
</div>

Here *k* is the Boltzmann constant and has a value of 1.38 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo></math>

 10<sup>−23</sup> J/K.

As for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final (*S*<sub>f</sub>) and initial (*S*<sub>i</sub>) values:

</div>

For processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, *W*<sub>f</sub> &gt; *W*<sub>i</sub>, the entropy of the system increases, Δ*S* &gt; 0. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, *W*<sub>f</sub> &lt; *W*<sub>i</sub>, yield a decrease in system entropy, Δ*S* &lt; 0. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.

Consider the general case of a system comprised of *N* particles distributed among *n* boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is *n<sup>N</sup>*. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 different microstates as illustrated in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_16_02_Microstates). Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called *distributions*. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, *the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy*.

As you add more particles to the system, the number of possible microstates increases exponentially (2<sup>*N*</sup>). A macroscopic (laboratory-sized) system would typically consist of moles of particles (*N* ~ 10<sup>23</sup>), and the corresponding number of microstates would be staggeringly huge. Regardless of the number of particles in the system, however, the distributions in which roughly equal numbers of particles are found in each box are always the most probable configurations.

The previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum ([\[link\]](/m51137#CNX_Chem_16_02_Gas)) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. The spontaneous process whereby the gas contained initially in one flask expands to fill both flasks equally therefore yields an increase in entropy for the system.

A similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of energy (represented as “\*”) in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_16_03_Energy). The hot object is comprised of particles **A** and **B** and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles **C** and **D**, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. And so, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>7</mn><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 As for the previous example of matter dispersal, extrapolating this treatment to macroscopic collections of particles dramatically increases the probability of the uniform distribution relative to the other distributions. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects’ temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.

# Predicting the Sign of Δ*S*

The relationships between entropy, microstates, and matter/energy dispersal described previously allow us to make generalizations regarding the relative entropies of substances and to predict the sign of entropy changes for chemical and physical processes. Consider the phase changes illustrated in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_16_03_Entropies). In the solid phase, the atoms or molecules are restricted to nearly fixed positions with respect to each other and are capable of only modest oscillations about these positions. With essentially fixed locations for the system’s component particles, the number of microstates is relatively small. In the liquid phase, the atoms or molecules are free to move over and around each other, though they remain in relatively close proximity to one another. This increased freedom of motion results in a greater variation in possible particle locations, so the number of microstates is correspondingly greater than for the solid. As a result, *S*<sub>liquid</sub> &gt; *S*<sub>solid</sub> and the process of converting a substance from solid to liquid (melting) is characterized by an increase in entropy, Δ*S* &gt; 0. By the same logic, the reciprocal process (freezing) exhibits a decrease in entropy, Δ*S* &lt; 0.

 ![Three stoppered flasks are shown with right and left-facing arrows in between each; the first is labeled above as, &#x201C;delta S greater than 0,&#x201D; and below as, &#x201C;delta S less than 0,&#x201D; while the second is labeled above as, &#x201C;delta S greater than 0,&#x201D; and below as, &#x201C;delta S less than 0.&#x201D; A long, right-facing arrow is drawn above all the flasks and labeled, &#x201C;Increasing entropy.&#x201D; The left flask contains twenty-seven particles arranged in a cube in the bottom of the flask and is labeled, &#x201C;Crystalline solid,&#x201D; below. The middle flask contains twenty-seven particles dispersed randomly in the bottom of the flask and is labeled, &#x201C;Liquid,&#x201D; below. The right flask contains twenty-seven particles dispersed inside of the flask and moving rapidly and is labeled, &#x201C;Gas,&#x201D; below.](../resources/CNX_Chem_16_03_Entropies.jpg "The entropy of a substance increases (&#x394;S &gt; 0) as it transforms from a relatively ordered solid, to a less-ordered liquid, and then to a still less-ordered gas. The entropy decreases (&#x394;S &lt; 0) as the substance transforms from a gas to a liquid and then to a solid."){: #CNX_Chem_16_03_Entropies}

Now consider the vapor or gas phase. The atoms or molecules occupy a *much* greater volume than in the liquid phase; therefore each atom or molecule can be found in many more locations than in the liquid (or solid) phase. Consequently, for any substance, *S*<sub>gas</sub> &gt; *S*<sub>liquid</sub> &gt; *S*<sub>solid</sub>, and the processes of vaporization and sublimation likewise involve increases in entropy, Δ*S* &gt; 0. Likewise, the reciprocal phase transitions, condensation and deposition, involve decreases in entropy, Δ*S* &lt; 0.

According to kinetic-molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Raising the temperature of a substance will result in more extensive vibrations of the particles in solids and more rapid translations of the particles in liquids and gases. At higher temperatures, the distribution of kinetic energies among the atoms or molecules of the substance is also broader (more dispersed) than at lower temperatures. Thus, the entropy for any substance increases with temperature ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_16_02_EntGraph)).

 ![Two graphs are shown. The y-axis of the left graph is labeled, &#x201C;Fraction of molecules,&#x201D; while the x-axis is labeled, &#x201C;Velocity, v ( m / s ),&#x201D; and has values of 0 through 1,500 along the axis with increments of 500.

The fourth line, labeled, &#x201C;1000 K,&#x201D; peaks around 750 m / s and is the lowest of the four on the y-axis. Each line get increasingly broad.

A line extends slightly upward through the first column in a slight upward direction, then goes straight up in the transition between the first two columns.

Try this [simulator][1] with interactive visualization of the dependence of particle location and freedom of motion on physical state and temperature.

</div>

The entropy of a substance is influenced by structure of the particles (atoms or molecules) that comprise the substance. With regard to atomic substances, heavier atoms possess greater entropy at a given temperature than lighter atoms, which is a consequence of the relation between a particle’s mass and the spacing of quantized translational energy levels (which is a topic beyond the scope of our treatment). For molecules, greater numbers of atoms (regardless of their masses) increase the ways in which the molecules can vibrate and thus the number of possible microstates and the system entropy.

Finally, variations in the types of particles affects the entropy of a system. Compared to a pure substance, in which all particles are identical, the entropy of a mixture of two or more different particle types is greater. This is because of the additional orientations and interactions that are possible in a system comprised of nonidentical components. For example, when a solid dissolves in a liquid, the particles of the solid experience both a greater freedom of motion and additional interactions with the solvent particles. This corresponds to a more uniform dispersal of matter and energy and a greater number of microstates. The process of dissolution therefore involves an increase in entropy, Δ*S* &gt; 0.

Considering the various factors that affect entropy allows us to make informed predictions of the sign of Δ*S* for various chemical and physical processes as illustrated in [\[link\]](#fs-idm151499136).

# Key Concepts and Summary

Entropy (*S*) is a state function that can be related to the number of microstates for a system (the number of ways the system can be arranged) and to the ratio of reversible heat to kelvin temperature. It may be interpreted as a measure of the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy in a system, and it is often described as representing the “disorder” of the system.

For a given substance, *S*<sub>solid</sub> &lt; *S*<sub>liquid</sub> &lt; *S*<sub>gas</sub> in a given physical state at a given temperature, entropy is typically greater for heavier atoms or more complex molecules. Entropy increases when a system is heated and when solutions form. Using these guidelines, the sign of entropy changes for some chemical reactions may be reliably predicted.

Consider a system similar to the one in [[link]](#CNX_Chem_16_02_Microstates), except that it contains six particles instead of four. What is the probability of having all the particles in only one of the two boxes in the case? Compare this with the similar probability for the system of four particles that we have derived to be equal to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>

 This probability is noticeably lower than the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

 result for the four-particle system. The conclusion we can make is that the probability for all the particles to stay in only one part of the system will decrease rapidly as the number of particles increases, and, for instance, the probability for all molecules of gas to gather in only one side of a room at room temperature and pressure is negligible since the number of gas molecules in the room is very large.

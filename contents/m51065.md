During the seventeenth and especially eighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest to make balloons in which they could fly ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_Ballooning)), a number of scientists established the relationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an *ideal* gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the *ideal gas law*—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.

When the hydrogen-filled balloon depicted in (a) landed, the frightened villagers of Gonesse reportedly destroyed it with pitchforks and knives. The launch of the latter was reportedly viewed by 400,000 people in Paris."){: #CNX_Chem_09_02_Ballooning}

### Pressure and Temperature: Amontons’s Law

Imagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_01_Amontons1)) and the pressure increases.

 ![This figure includes three similar diagrams. In the first diagram to the left, a rigid spherical container of a gas to which a pressure gauge is attached at the top is placed in a large beaker of water, indicated in light blue, atop a hot plate. The needle on the pressure gauge points to the far left on the gauge. The diagram is labeled &#x201C;low P&#x201D; above and &#x201C;hot plate off&#x201D; below. The second similar diagram also has the rigid spherical container of gas placed in a large beaker from which light blue wavy line segments extend from the top of the liquid in the beaker. The beaker is situated on top of a slightly reddened circular area. The needle on the pressure gauge points straight up, or to the middle on the gauge. The diagram is labeled &#x201C;medium P&#x201D; above and &#x201C;hot plate on medium&#x201D; below. The third diagram also has the rigid spherical container of gas placed in a large beaker in which bubbles appear near the liquid surface and several wavy light blue line segments extend from the surface out of the beaker. The beaker is situated on top of a bright red circular area. The needle on the pressure gauge points to the far right on the gauge. The diagram is labeled &#x201C;high P&#x201D; above and &#x201C;hot plate on high&#x201D; below.](../resources/CNX_Chem_09_01_Amontons1.jpg "The effect of temperature on gas pressure: When the hot plate is off, the pressure of the gas in the sphere is relatively low. As the gas is heated, the pressure of the gas in the sphere increases."){: #CNX_Chem_09_01_Amontons1}

This relationship between temperature and pressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these conditions in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_Amontons2). We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then *P* and *T* are directly proportional (again, when *volume and moles of gas are held constant*); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the same factor.

 ![This figure includes a table and a graph. The table has 3 columns and 7 rows. The first row is a header, which labels the columns &#x201C;Temperature, degrees C,&#x201D; &#x201C;Temperature, K,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Pressure, k P a.&#x201D; The first column contains the values from top to bottom negative 150, negative 100, negative 50, 0, 50, and 100. The second column contains the values from top to bottom 173, 223, 273, 323, 373, and 423. The third column contains the values 36.0, 46.4, 56.7, 67.1, 77.5, and 88.0. A graph appears to the right of the table. The horizontal axis is labeled &#x201C;Temperature ( K ).&#x201D; with markings and labels provided for multiples of 100 beginning at 0 and ending at 500. The vertical axis is labeled &#x201C;Pressure ( k P a )&#x201D; with markings and labels provided for multiples of 10, beginning at 0 and ending at 100. Six data points from the table are plotted on the graph with black dots. These dots are connected with a solid black line. A dashed line extends from the data point furthest to the left to the origin. The graph shows a positive linear trend.](../resources/CNX_Chem_09_02_Amontons2.jpg "For a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional, provided the temperature is in kelvin. (Measurements cannot be made at lower temperatures because of the condensation of the gas.)

Guillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this, the *P*-*T* relationship for gases is known as either **Amontons’s law**{: data-type="term"} or **Gay-Lussac’s law**{: data-type="term"}. Under either name, it states that *the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant*. Mathematically, this can be written:

where ∝ means “is proportional to,” and *k* is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and volume of the gas.

For a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mi>P</mi><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>

). If the gas is initially in “Condition 1” (with *P* = *P*<sub>1</sub> and *T* = *T*<sub>1</sub>), and then changes to “Condition 2” (with *P* = *P*<sub>2</sub> and *T* = *T*<sub>2</sub>), we have that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em" /><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></math>

 This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations (0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called **absolute zero**{: data-type="term"}). (Also note that there are at least three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.)

### Volume and Temperature: Charles’s Law

If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount of air at atmospheric pressure, let’s say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.

This [video][1] shows how cooling and heating a gas causes its volume to decrease or increase, respectively.

These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases. Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed and graphed in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_Charles2).

The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at constant pressure is known as Charles’s law in recognition of the French scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre César Charles. **Charles’s law**{: data-type="term"} states that *the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is held constant*.

Mathematically, this can be written as:

### Volume and Pressure: Boyle’s Law

If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a specific amount of air at constant temperature, say 25 °C. If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa. Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1).

 ![This figure contains a diagram and two graphs. The diagram shows a syringe labeled with a scale in m l or c c with multiples of 5 labeled beginning at 5 and ending at 30. The markings halfway between these measurements are also provided. Attached at the top of the syringe is a pressure gauge with a scale marked by fives from 40 on the left to 5 on the right. The gauge needle rests between 10 and 15, slightly closer to 15. The syringe plunger position indicates a volume measurement about halfway between 10 and 15 m l or c c. The first graph is labeled &#x201C;V ( m L )&#x201D; on the horizontal axis and &#x201C;P ( p s i )&#x201D; on the vertical axis. Points are labeled at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 m L with corresponding values of 39.0, 19.5, 13.0, 9.8, and 6.5 p s i. The points are connected with a smooth curve that is declining at a decreasing rate of change. The second graph is labeled &#x201C;V ( m L )&#x201D; on the horizontal axis and &#x201C;1 divided by P ( p s i )&#x201D; on the vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled at multiples of 5, beginning at zero and extending up to 35 m L. The vertical axis is labeled by multiples of 0.02, beginning at 0 and extending up to 0.18. Six points indicated by black dots on this graph are connected with a black line segment showing a positive linear trend.](../resources/CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1.jpg "When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change). Since P and V are inversely proportional, a graph of 1P vs. V is linear."){: #CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1}

Unlike the *P*-*T* and *V*-*T* relationships, pressure and volume are not directly proportional to each other. Instead, *P* and *V* exhibit inverse proportionality: Increasing the pressure results in a decrease of the volume of the gas. Mathematically this can be written:

The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher Robert Boyle over 300 years ago.

Breathing and Boyle’s Law
</div>
What do you do about 20 times per minute for your whole life, without break, and often without even being aware of it? The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas laws apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon dioxide). Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When you inhale, your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding your chest cavity and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure (Boyle’s law). This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you exhale, the process reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your lung volume decreases, causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s law cycle for the rest of your life ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_BoylesLaw4)).

### Moles of Gas and Volume: Avogadro’s Law

The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account for the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental observations as expressed by **Avogadro’s law**{: data-type="term"}\: *For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature both remain constant*.

In equation form, this is written as:

<div data-type="equation">

### The Ideal Gas Law

To this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the gas:

* Boyle’s law: *PV* = constant at constant *T* and *n*
* Amontons’s law:
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mi>P</mi><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>
  
  = constant at constant *V* and *n*
* Charles’s law:
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mi>V</mi><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>
  
  = constant at constant *P* and *n*
* Avogadro’s law:
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mi>V</mi><mi>n</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>
  
  = constant at constant *P* and *T*
{: data-bullet-style="bullet"}

Combining these four laws yields the **ideal gas law**{: data-type="term"}, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas:

<div data-type="equation">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow></math>
</div>

where *P* is the pressure of a gas, *V* is its volume, *n* is the number of moles of the gas, *T* is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and *R* is a constant called the **ideal gas constant**{: data-type="term"} or the universal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm mol<sup>–1</sup> K<sup>–1</sup> and 8.314 kPa L mol<sup>–1</sup> K<sup>–1</sup>.

Gases whose properties of *P*, *V*, and *T* are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit *ideal behavior* or to approximate the traits of an **ideal gas**{: data-type="term"}. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that may be used along with *kinetic molecular theory* to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the *non-ideal* behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.

The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant *R* and the variable properties *P*, *V*, *n*, and *T*. Specifying any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following example exercises.

<span data-type="title">Solution</span> We must rearrange *PV* = *nRT* to solve for *V*\: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em" /><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow><mi>P</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>

If we choose to use *R* = 0.08206 L atm mol<sup>–1</sup> K<sup>–1</sup>, then the amount must be in moles, temperature must be in kelvin, and pressure must be in atm.

The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving
</div>
Whether scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia (shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_GreatBarri)) or in the Caribbean, divers must understand how pressure affects a number of issues related to their comfort and safety.

![This picture shows colorful underwater corals and anemones in hues of yellow, orange, green, and brown, surrounded by water that appears blue in color.](../resources/CNX_Chem_09_02_GreatBarri.jpg "Scuba divers, whether at the Great Barrier Reef or in the Caribbean, must be aware of buoyancy, pressure equalization, and the amount of time they spend underwater, to avoid the risks associated with pressurized gases in the body. (credit: Kyle Taylor)"){: #CNX_Chem_09_02_GreatBarri}


Pressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as “atmospheres absolute” or ATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body’s air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in his BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle’s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and she or he begins to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface.

</div>

### Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a **standard temperature and pressure (STP)**{: data-type="term"} for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). At STP, one mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 L—this is referred to as the **standard molar volume**{: data-type="term"} ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_09_02_HENH3O2)).

![This figure shows three balloons each filled with H e, N H subscript 2, and O subscript 2 respectively. Beneath the first balloon is the label &#x201C;4 g of He&#x201D; Beneath the second balloon is the label, &#x201C;15 g of N H subscript 2.&#x201D; Beneath the third balloon is the label &#x201C;32 g of O subscript 2.&#x201D; Each balloon contains the same number of molecules of their respective gases.](../resources/CNX_Chem_09_02_HENH3O2.jpg "Since the number of moles in a given volume of gas varies with pressure and temperature changes, chemists use standard temperature and pressure (273.15 K and 1 atm or 101.325 kPa) to report properties of gases."){: #CNX_Chem_09_02_HENH3O2}

### Key Concepts and Summary

The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle’s law). Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro’s law).

The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, *PV* = *nRT*, where *P* is the pressure of the gas, *V* is its volume, *n* is the number of moles of the gas, *T* is its kelvin temperature, and *R* is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

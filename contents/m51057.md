Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration 1*s*<sup>2</sup>2*s*<sup>2</sup>2*p*<sup>4</sup>, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2*p* orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H bonds form from the overlap of these two 2*p* orbitals with the 1*s* orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Ovb), because *p* orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5°, not 90°. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.

 ![Two peanut-shaped orbitals lie perpendicular to one another. They overlap with spherical orbitals to the left and top of the diagram.](../resources/CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Ovb.jpg "The hypothetical overlap of two of the 2p orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90&#xB0;. This is not consistent with experimental evidence.1"){: #CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Ovb}

Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H<sub>2</sub>O differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1*s* orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2*p* orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, *ψ*, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called **hybridization**{: data-type="term"} and is mathematically accomplished by the *linear combination of atomic orbitals*, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called **hybrid orbitals**{: data-type="term"}. The valence orbitals in an *isolated* oxygen atom are a 2*s* orbital and three 2*p* orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Otet)). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The observed angle of 104.5° is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.

This description is more consistent with the experimental structure."){: #CNX_Chem_08_02_H2Otet}

The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:

1.  Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms.
2.  Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms.
3.  A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set.
4.  All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy.
5.  The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by the VSEPR theory.
6.  Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds. Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form π bonds.

In the following sections, we shall discuss the common types of hybrid orbitals.

# *sp* Hybridization

The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl<sub>2</sub> molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom’s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence *s* orbital with one of the valence *p* orbitals to yield two equivalent ***sp* hybrid orbitals**{: data-type="term"} that are oriented in a linear geometry ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_spGeom)). In this figure, the set of *sp* orbitals appears similar in shape to the original *p* orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals formed. The *p* orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The *sp* set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180° from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the *s* orbital are now distributed to the two *sp* orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous BeCl<sub>2</sub>, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical σ bonds.

We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_spDiag). These diagrams represent each orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate two electrons of opposite spin.

Each of the two sp hybrid orbitals holds one electron and is thus half filled and available for bonding via overlap with a Cl 3p orbital."){: #CNX_Chem_08_02_spDiag}

When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the *sp* orbitals gets one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap during the formation of the Be–Cl bonds.

Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a molecule will exhibit *sp* hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom in the linear HgCl<sub>2</sub> molecule, the zinc atom in Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which contains a linear C–Zn–C arrangement, and the carbon atoms in HCCH and CO<sub>2</sub>.

# *sp*<sup>2</sup> Hybridization

The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density consist of a set of three ***sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals**{: data-type="term"} and one unhybridized *p* orbital. This arrangement results from *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization, the mixing of one *s* orbital and two *p* orbitals to produce three identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_sp2Geom)).

Although quantum mechanics yields the “plump” orbital lobes as depicted in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_sp2Geom), sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor lobes, as in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_sp2Conv), to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use these “thinner” representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily visualize.

The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH<sub>3,</sub> suggests *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen atoms ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_BH3)). We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH<sub>3</sub> as shown in the orbital energy level diagram in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_BH3Diag). We redistribute the three valence electrons of the boron atom in the three *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when B–H bonds form.

A molecule of methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane exhibits *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridization.

In a methane molecule, the 1*s* orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps with one of the four *sp*<sup>3</sup> orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma (σ) bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the methane molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>.

The structure of ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6,</sub> is similar to that of methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron—three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom ([\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_ethane)). However, in ethane an *sp*<sup>3</sup> orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an *sp*<sup>3</sup> orbital of a second carbon atom to form a σ bond between the two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals overlaps with an *s* orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbon–hydrogen σ bonds. The structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane are shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_ethane). The orientation of the two CH<sub>3</sub> groups is not fixed relative to each other. Experimental evidence shows that rotation around σ bonds occurs easily.

An *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The nitrogen atom is *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by the lone pair.

The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen atom is *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5°, but the observed angles in ammonia (107.3°) and water (104.5°) are slightly smaller. Other examples of *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridization include CCl<sub>4</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>, and NCl<sub>3</sub>.

To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the *s* orbital, the three *p* orbitals, and one of the *d* orbitals), which gives five ***sp*<sup>3</sup>*d* hybrid orbitals**{: data-type="term"}. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six valence shell atomic orbitals (the *s* orbital, the three *p* orbitals, and two of the *d* orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six ***sp*<sup>3</sup>*d*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals**{: data-type="term"}. These hybridizations are only possible for atoms that have *d* orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not those in the first or second period).

In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>, there are five P–Cl bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid.

# Assignment of Hybrid Orbitals to Central Atoms

The hybridization of an atom is determined based on the number of regions of electron density that surround it. The geometrical arrangements characteristic of the various sets of hybrid orbitals are shown in [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_HybrdOrbit). These arrangements are identical to those of the electron-pair geometries predicted by VSEPR theory. VSEPR theory predicts the shapes of molecules, and hybrid orbital theory provides an explanation for how those shapes are formed. To find the hybridization of a central atom, we can use the following guidelines:

1.  Determine the Lewis structure of the molecule.
2.  Determine the number of regions of electron density around an atom using VSEPR theory, in which single bonds, multiple bonds, radicals, and lone pairs each count as one region.
3.  Assign the set of hybridized orbitals from [\[link\]](#CNX_Chem_08_02_HybrdOrbit) that corresponds to this geometry.

For example, an atom surrounded by three regions of electron density is sp2 hybridized, and the three sp2 orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion."){: #CNX_Chem_08_02_HybrdOrbit}

It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the H–O–H bond angle in H<sub>2</sub>O, 104.5°, which is more consistent with *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals (109.5°) on the central atom than with 2*p* orbitals (90°). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and H<sub>2</sub>S has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle (92.1°), which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for H<sub>2</sub>Te, the observed bond angle (90°) is consistent with overlap of the 5*p* orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain the observed structures.

# Key Concepts and Summary

We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (σ) bonds directed toward other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions of electron density about it. Two such regions imply *sp* hybridization; three, *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization; four, *sp*<sup>3</sup> hybridization; five, *sp*<sup>3</sup>*d* hybridization; and six, *sp*<sup>3</sup>*d*<sup>2</sup> hybridization. Pi (π) bonds are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (*p* or *d* orbitals).
